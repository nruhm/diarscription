YESTERDAY AND IT'S KIND OF TODAY TALKING TO YOU GUYS

2
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:06,852
where we put everything that we think will fit into

3
00:00:09,363 --> 00:00:10,935
in the sprint.
#

4
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:14,783
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had two weeks actually developing the sprint

5
00:00:14,763 --> 00:00:17,871
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we'll have one week afterwards where

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:23,254
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, testing is going to be hammering it and we'll be going back and forth with them to make sure everything's right.

7
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:29,093
[SPEAKER_00]: and then once that one week hard experience over we'll release it um and so

8
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:33,953
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it works is, I think, which

9
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:40,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there will be some overlap between the hardening and the next sprint.

10
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:42,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we might go ahead and start working on the next sprint.

11
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,550
[SPEAKER_00]: The vial testing is running through everything.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,718
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is like the timelines that he has for the ones that we're currently

13
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:50,794
[SPEAKER_00]: working on or, you know, getting ready.

14
00:00:50,854 --> 00:00:53,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting Monday is when this next sprint

15
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:57,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Will start, we got the two weeks, and then they'll end on October 3rd.

16
00:00:57,743 --> 00:01:01,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess then hardening starts and then that will be done.

17
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:08,108
[SPEAKER_00]: October 10th and then release and then we'll start the next sprint.

18
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:13,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then this is everything that we had deemed

19
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:17,490
[SPEAKER_00]: would fit into this sprint.

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you have a question on here.

21
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,152
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to check with you guys, like is this list

22
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this work for you guys?

23
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:23,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this like the priority?

24
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:26,738
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you would like to see go into this and if not,

25
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:32,728
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of look at it again I guess and see if we need to make any changes or not.

26
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:38,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got that ready if you want to jump into that now

27
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,327
[SPEAKER_01]: wait till after the slide.

28
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:41,915
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that this is pretty much it.

29
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the reason I had some.

30
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:51,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the number one thing that we had down was just...

31
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:57,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 100% sure we're good on all of the fidelity stuff.

32
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:01,686
[SPEAKER_00]: okay 
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to send the census this week

33
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:05,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're working on the money file, should have all that ready.

34
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,980
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanna make sure we have everything prepared

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

36
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:12,604
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we- 
[SPEAKER_01]: 9 of 26, right, is the-

37
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:14,233
[SPEAKER_01]: is the last transmission.

38
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:18,595
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be this week today or tomorrow.

39
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:23,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we're kind of allotting for time for that during all this.

40
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:28,213
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made sure we left some hours available for if there's any

41
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:31,268
[SPEAKER_00]: high priority issues that come up.

42
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:35,470
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that, generating these census files if there's any changes needed.

43
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:41,308
[SPEAKER_00]: we have like kind of some time buffer within this to do all that stuff 
[SPEAKER_01]: okay so that was number one

44
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:47,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, it says DevTicket 1103.

45
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:51,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I need that deployed to make 926.

46
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one was that?

47
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:56,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Second from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dev ticket 1103, number 7

48
00:02:56,206 --> 00:03:01,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

49
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that actually,

50
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:08,779
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a five-minute deal.

51
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,873
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a... 
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that one...

52
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:12,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that one.

53
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,498
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be too big of a problem.

54
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:17,961
[SPEAKER_00]: What day did you say you needed it by? 

55
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:21,775
[SPEAKER_01]: 9/26, because that Monday is like,

56
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:26,247
[SPEAKER_01]: that Monday would be a payroll cycle that's applicable to this.

57
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:29,993
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just going to try to look back and I needed to look forward.

58
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:33,756
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to buy 926.

59
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:41,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 926.

60
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:47,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I guess, so that's before the full plan release of everything.

61
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:52,707
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, we can take a look, maybe see if we can just like throw that in with the payroll release that's

62
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:56,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the only payroll issue out there, right?

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

64
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,038
[SPEAKER_00]: When do we have to switch over payroll to the 401k separate?

65
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:05,734
[SPEAKER_00]: When's the first date you're going to generate a money file for that?

66
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:09,987
[SPEAKER_01]: The first money file is October 2nd.

67
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm trying to think of a way that we could...

68
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:16,207
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have those together.

69
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:18,323
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need

70
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:25,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means the 29th, whenever I run payroll, I need the fidelity file on there.

71
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:29,781
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whenever I create that money file, it's got to read fidelity.

72
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,515
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it, September 29th?

73
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:36,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what day would you be running payroll?

74
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:37,746
[SPEAKER_01]: September 29th?

75
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:41,661
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're uploading the contributions

76
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,344
[SPEAKER_01]: on the second with that Michael Koshner.

77
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:48,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so 29.

78
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:54,452
[SPEAKER_01]: But the 29th, whenever I run payroll, I need that to refill 20 months.

79
00:04:56,862 --> 00:05:01,101
[SPEAKER_01]: The 22nd is the last one that we are uploading to.

80
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:04,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a Monday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

81
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:08,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm a little confused.

82
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,315
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the 9th, 26th then,

83
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:14,042
[SPEAKER_00]: The 926, so that's on Friday.

84
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,833
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be actually the 922.

85
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:19,967
[SPEAKER_00]: payroll that you're going to be running
[SPEAKER_01]: For the 9th? 

86
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:22,683
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about two separate things.

87
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:24,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Two separate things.

88
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:26,124
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get the date straight on those.

89
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:30,008
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to see if there's a way that we can do those in the same release.

90
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:34,142
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the...

91
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:38,530
[SPEAKER_00]: the 11-03 pay-to-date thing for the health care checks.

92
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,707
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that's up by 926.

93
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:43,407
[SPEAKER_00]: So would that mean that you're going to be running the payroll on 929?

94
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can throw both of them.

95
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:47,208
[SPEAKER_01]: So the money file change?

96
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:48,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

97
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:50,052
[SPEAKER_01]: can go in at 926.

98
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, okay, yeah, let me get it in.

99
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:56,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm going to run the payroll at 29.

100
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:59,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that money file is for you fidelity.

101
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:02,965
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have a meeting scheduled with Michael on the 2nd.

102
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,578
[SPEAKER_01]: to upload those contributions.

103
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,118
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our first upload of fidelity.

104
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:07,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

105
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

106
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,714
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some things in there, Ethan, that you're not going to do.

107
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:17,005
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to be able to...

108
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,712
[SPEAKER_01]: 

109
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:22,084
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's got to change.

110
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:25,290
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

111
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

112
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:31,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're trying to make all the business plans, but like that little thing there,

113
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:31,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

114
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:35,415
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got the five-inch job for you to switch that date on those.

115
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:38,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

116
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is that we also have to run through testing

117
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:45,118
[SPEAKER_01]: and other stuff, but yeah, I guess we're trying to get it to,

118
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:50,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess a process where we can kind of like

119
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:56,205
[SPEAKER_01]: plan out two weeks of work and just you know we've got to disappear for those two weeks unless like something super urgent comes up

120
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:59,378
[SPEAKER_01]: just hammer that all out and then release it all.

121
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:04,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know that's a good, I like the structure, I think we should do that better.

122
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,533
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think there's going to be

123
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:11,038
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still big things in there like this.

124
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:12,995
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no different.

125
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,548
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to be on that one.

126
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:15,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

127
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:18,666
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of get to the point where we can kind of

128
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:23,830
[SPEAKER_00]: figure these out way in advance and then we can kind of

129
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,314
[SPEAKER_00]: get to it in a manner of like, you know, a time where, you know, we have plenty of time to get to it and it's not urgent.

130
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:32,852
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I understand that every step like that comes out.

131
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:33,398
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

132
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:38,089
[SPEAKER_02]: keep that in mind whenever we're scheduling or not scheduling whenever we're

133
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:43,658
[SPEAKER_02]: planning out all these spreads to like we're leaving time in there to do these.

134
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:46,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're square on that.

135
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:48,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have on 926,

136
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:52,939
[SPEAKER_01]: with pay date changes and then also we're flipping from

137
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Transamerica to a Fidelity Contribution Fund.

138
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

139
00:07:57,762 --> 00:08:02,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, I had dev ticket 1106.

140
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,365
[SPEAKER_01]: That 1095 discrepancy?

141
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:05,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

142
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:07,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to send that file on 10.1.

143
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:09,564
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have a 1015.

144
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:13,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to give them time to review that file.

145
# This was never said 
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,564
[SPEAKER_00]: AND I THINK IT'S NOT

146
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:23,297
[SPEAKER_01]: review any changes or if there's any discrepancies.

147
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:24,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

148
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:29,288
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have a meeting scheduled 10-15.

149
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:32,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one was that?

150
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,865
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 1106 and 95 discrepancy.

151
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:38,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay. 

152
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:44,577
[SPEAKER_01]: which their file, it's been right, so I don't know what changed.

153
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,274
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be kind of nice when you look at that to see what did change.

154
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:57,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we ran that thing for months.

155
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:59,861
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple, maybe a year and a half a year.

156
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:02,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something doesn't change.

157
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:08,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that one's still kind of an enigma, so I was probably not really sure what's happened there either.

158
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:13,315
[SPEAKER_01]: So next thing I had,

159
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:17,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that they're big 1095, the break,

160
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:19,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of over my head.

161
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the inventory management one?

162
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not sure what that is.

163
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:27,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he said that, and we realized afterwards that that's kind of out of our court.

164
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:30,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg actually already sorted that out.

165
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:36,231
[SPEAKER_01]: The number...

166
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:43,572
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had 1031, starting to get into that GCHP.

167
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Mhm.

168
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the only thing I had after that was

169
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:53,815
[SPEAKER_00]: All the check fits together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mhm. 

170
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:58,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Dev ticket 741, we closed.

171
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:03,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Dev Ticket 553, we can close.

172
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:06,131
[SPEAKER_01]: 741, we can close.

173
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:09,508
[SPEAKER_01]: 741, 553.

174
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:12,428
[SPEAKER_01]: We can close 695.

175
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:19,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made a comment on 801.

176
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,122
[SPEAKER_01]: That the first part of that is done.

177
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:22,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I read my...

178
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running my balance sheet with the earnings piece on 801.

179
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't recall any of that.

180
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember our issue.

181
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:38,415
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting one mountain from one place and one in the other, but I can't recreate it.

182
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:41,689
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want to go ahead until I can find a dream to see.

183
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay at the moment.

184
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:46,684
[SPEAKER_00]: With that one, I think the plan was we talked about

185
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:52,472
[SPEAKER_00]: having balance sheet actually call the same bit of code that retained earnings report does.

186
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:58,227
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think balance sheet is kind of recalculating everything itself, and that's what it is.

187
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:02,530
[SPEAKER_00]: discrepancies, so I think it would still be a worthwhile improvement.

188
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but the first part of that thing, that's the only thing I'm missing.

189
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:07,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

190
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:11,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we noted that we kind of cleared that like in our estimate on the time on that.

191
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that you commented on there.

192
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:19,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the Dev 553 though, that one I didn't think had ever been worked on.

193
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:24,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got off the phone with Kevin and

194
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:25,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, is it relevant?

195
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:27,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had any other issues?

196
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said no.

197
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:34,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's unable, he can't think of any examples since.

198
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:39,739
[SPEAKER_01]: because they put in that ticket in like January and so

199
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:43,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's one of those things where for Pops to begin,

200
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Prioritize the ticket.

201
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:46,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I may take a look

202
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:49,813
[SPEAKER_00]: at it because I remember I had the exact steps to reproduce that

203
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:54,589
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something that didn't come up very often, but it was basically

204
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:58,555
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went to go edit a sale where

205
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:02,672
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think it's where they can like change the ship to the customer or

206
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:06,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the Shift 2 on the sale isn't one that can be found anymore.

207
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:07,785
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just default.

208
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:13,776
[SPEAKER_00]: to whatever their current ship to is, and then it would recalculate all the tax and mess everything up.

209
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:18,720
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cold on Kevin.

210
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:24,087
[SPEAKER_01]: because we were trying to to recall what that was and

211
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:27,563
[SPEAKER_01]: But okay, it sounds like you've got a lead on that.

212
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was one that came up twice maybe, and then it was like,

213
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:34,956
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to track down, kind of screwed everything up with the sales tax.

214
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

215
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,354
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't had any flags on it.

216
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:45,720
[SPEAKER_01]: I would throw that ahead of probably the ACH and the Jack Smith piece then.

217
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's kind of

218
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:49,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm happy they hurt Cindy.

219
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:52,317
[SPEAKER_01]: They would call out on Cindy, like she would get the flag.

220
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:52,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

221
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:53,685
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't match.

222
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:59,490
[SPEAKER_01]: The one example that Kevin had, we were able to get a resale certificate on.

223
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of became a non-issue.

224
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:04,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it is an issue either.

225
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:12,619
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this list that we have here, I think that pretty much everything that you've mentioned is in here.

226
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:18,407
[SPEAKER_00]: the only thing that out of the list that we did send you I think there's really only one thing that we

227
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:23,115
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't think would fit in the sprint, and that was like all the missing checksmith reports.

228
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:26,845
[SPEAKER_00]: we were kind of thinking that that would be unless we have you know

229
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:32,835
[SPEAKER_00]: we might end up being into the 401k stuff but for the next sprint but if not then like the Chex Smith report

230
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:36,885
[SPEAKER_00]: would be good to work on there but we still were gonna like fix all the bugs and

231
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:42,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the feedback and stuff, you guys had them checked in on this upcoming room.

232
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,008
[SPEAKER_01]: uh,

233
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:51,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything we have mentioned here, we should be...

234
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:55,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that 11, 12,

235
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's done.

236
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:01,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked Marley yesterday.

237
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:07,564
[SPEAKER_01]: 11, 12.

238
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:10,109
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no number or order.

239
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's done.

240
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,339
[SPEAKER_01]: What you guys did was reset all the PNC customers.

241
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:21,385
[SPEAKER_01]: He wiped out their information, so they had to re-verify the accounts.

242
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:25,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was the one that Matt did.

243
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:28,101
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't get that sorted out.

244
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:33,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if DNC did or strike, but I think as far as we're concerned.

245
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,842
[SPEAKER_01]: We are done with that.

246
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

247
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just in the order that

248
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:44,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you're on that or not.

249
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,689
[SPEAKER_01]: That email with Krishna.

250
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:50,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I just printed it out and kind of wrote on it.

251
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put in that finance team.

252
00:15:03,265 --> 00:15:08,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like looking at this compared to like what we have on the plan here I think

253
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,796
[SPEAKER_00]: everything lines up.

254
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, building through here, we got the

255
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:15,596
[SPEAKER_00]: That first one, 741, you said we could close.

256
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:17,629
[SPEAKER_00]: The 1031 is the

257
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,930
[SPEAKER_00]: which that's the biggest chunk of this.

258
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,645
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thinking that's gonna take up

259
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:25,307
[SPEAKER_00]: the majority of this sprint and then

260
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:29,172
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got that 553 at SafeSail being changed.

261
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:30,421
[SPEAKER_00]: That shouldn't be too bad.

262
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:33,120
[SPEAKER_00]: The 1095 thing,

263
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:36,196
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the retained earnings report change.

264
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:39,077
[SPEAKER_00]: That should also be a pretty quick, easy thing.

265
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:45,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Really the only other bigger part of it would be like the checksmith bones and stuff.

266
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:47,301
[SPEAKER_00]: But does that all sound good to you guys?

267
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:48,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not for the end.

268
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:53,252
[SPEAKER_01]: like the check smith thing or the ach that's just kind of like i would push it to the end

269
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:58,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure we get everything else done, and then if we have time, work goes in.

270
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:02,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the list, like the order here is kind of the priority we were planning on going.

271
00:16:02,498 --> 00:16:03,985
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the top down,

272
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,984
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ACA is going to be the first thing.

273
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:07,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I will move it down.

274
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:12,321
[SPEAKER_01]: because I need the I'd like to have like you need the payroll

275
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:18,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I need that payroll thing, and then I need that 1095, so that needs to be above.

276
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:19,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

277
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got them ordered actually in the sprint now.

278
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:21,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethan.

279
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:22,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

280
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:23,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

281
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know it's just kind of like,

282
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:33,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to check down the list.

283
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:39,287
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's the list that i need just because i have dates on those yeah yeah okay

284
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:44,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I just went and reordered them as we were going.

285
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,691
[SPEAKER_02]: and his sprint, so it should be good now.

286
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:53,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Change the priority to highest.

287
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if they looked at it.

288
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on this, Ethan, so

289
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:01,495
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the two weeks, Brent, you're looking for something for the next.

290
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:04,498
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish.

291
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:07,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that'll be something we can kind of talk about later.

292
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:08,397
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the next one.

293
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:13,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's going to be like the next phase of the 401k or if that would be the checksmith reports.

294
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:16,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if there's anything else.

295
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:21,947
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I was thinking is like, we would have a two week dedicated spread

296
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:24,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Check smith, as it's own thing.

297
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we can knock.

298
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm trying to knock a big chunk of that out.

299
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:34,755
[SPEAKER_01]: which i know it's hard to dedicate two weeks to a project

300
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,383
[SPEAKER_01]: See what we can get on.

301
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:36,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

302
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:37,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got another.

303
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:38,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got this.

304
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:40,622
[SPEAKER_03]: sales manager IBM.

305
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:42,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to work out a little bit.

306
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:44,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I can have that ready in the next two weeks.

307
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Following that.

308
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:49,977
[SPEAKER_03]: After this, I'll push mine like...

309
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:52,904
[SPEAKER_03]: into October, because it doesn't need to be anything.

310
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:54,398
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like a new project.

311
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:59,124
[SPEAKER_01]: That would button up everything for us.

312
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so too.

313
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:05,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can scope that out with Krishna in the meantime.

314
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:08,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure they'll be reaching out to kind of

315
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:13,804
[SPEAKER_00]: gather what's coming up and figure out, plan everything out.

316
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:18,765
[SPEAKER_00]: But this this sprint was kind of mainly to address all the high priority stuff that we had and

317
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:24,418
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anything else that we can kind of squeeze in there with it is what we kind of did.

318
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:26,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

319
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:33,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just make sure we have everything else completed before we jump into any ACH or checklist.

320
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:37,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to test that file area there as well.

321
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:41,783
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as he gives us a new, or they put those in and they hold them out.

322
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:45,144
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try that in that sense as well.

323
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I have permission to run that now.

324
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:51,148
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever you guys are ready for it, just send me a message and I can...

325
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:52,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop on production.

326
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:55,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably sometime this afternoon.

327
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:58,303
[SPEAKER_01]: What time are you leaving?

328
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:03,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll shoot for like 3 o'clock or so if you don't care, just send me that.

329
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have everything buttoned down here.

330
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and towards the end of the day, and because we have the fidelity meeting at 2.30,

331
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:14,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I should be done by three and I can just hop off and sit in.

332
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:15,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And you probably have to,

333
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:21,642
[SPEAKER_01]: i might have been with us all we did that well if you wouldn't send that to him now because that's not really going to change

334
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:25,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

335
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,447
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll holler at this afternoon anytime.

336
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sounds good.

337
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,256
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be going to talk to you and pick up my daughter from school.

338
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:34,035
[SPEAKER_00]: three, but I'll be back right after that.

339
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,238
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth three is fine.

340
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:40,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be buttoned up after lunch, so they send it to me sometime after lunch.

341
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, sounds good.

342
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:45,798
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already there.

343
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting in now.

344
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:51,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why if you give me until after lunch, after 12, I'll be done.

345
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:52,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

346
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:53,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you should be good.

347
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll get that followed by Rand, and then we'll get with you.

348
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.

349
00:19:58,329 --> 00:19:59,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else or is that Ed?

350
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:00,927
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it.

351
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an extra slide on here.

352
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:05,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys have any other questions or anything.

353
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:11,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's the best idea to ask about

354
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Air and stuff, just to plan, I heard.

355
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:20,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Like after this couple of sprints, like sprint three and four.

356
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:23,961
[SPEAKER_04]: just to focus on that figure and stuff.

357
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:28,990
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll knock this one out and have him follow back up on the board.

358
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now put a thought into the head.

359
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:36,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either going to be one of the two.

360
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:40,650
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like, well, I guess the sales manager thing, if we can come up with that.

361
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll either be the check smith or

362
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:49,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, check smith will take two weeks for sure to knock all that out.

363
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:50,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, that's what we were kind of planning to do.

364
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I'm saying like if this is a pretty solid,

365
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you have to correct me, but I feel like a pretty solid two weeks.

366
00:20:58,096 --> 00:21:03,786
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday we all got together and we kind of looked through all these items that

367
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:07,735
[SPEAKER_00]: that Krishna sent you and we kind of put estimates on each thing and then

368
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:12,004
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of figured out what we could fit into two weeks.

369
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:15,261
[SPEAKER_00]: It should work out pretty smooth.

370
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:21,252
[SPEAKER_01]: following two weeks then we gotta check for the ACH thing if that kind of bleeds over so I mean I feel like

371
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:23,787
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a good four weeks here of work.

372
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:27,208
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to need some in this transition.

373
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:30,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

374
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:34,110
[SPEAKER_01]: While I got you this curiosity,

375
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you and Matt were working on something.

376
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:38,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that closed or no?

377
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Matt's been hitting a lot of snags with it.

378
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,163
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still not really sure how much longer that's going to be.

379
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:53,109
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of got like the prototype, but it's just getting the numbers to line up right.

380
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:54,900
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of having trouble with.

381
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,815
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was some kind of like where I

382
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:01,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I need access to a database, right?

383
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:03,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to pull all the supports myself.

384
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everyone's going to spoil it too much.

385
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:07,225
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cool to see.

386
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,295
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, essentially we're wanting to give you

387
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:14,290
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the reports and see the data that gives the number on the reports.

388
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:16,433
[SPEAKER_02]: just for our visibility.

389
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:17,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

390
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,133
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be nice I was just kind of curious. 

391
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:24,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not sure when we can expect

392
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:25,857
[SPEAKER_00]: that yet.

393
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:28,296
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's

394
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:33,308
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close, but it's also been close for like a week just because we're going to get the numbers.

395
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:38,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me when Christmas is around the corner.

396
00:22:38,097 --> 00:22:39,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

397
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:41,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sounds good.

398
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:42,077
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

399
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:44,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.

400
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:45,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.

401
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,431
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I went well.

402
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:55,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than they

403
00:22:55,208 --> 00:23:00,527
[SPEAKER_02]: The only part that I wish Christian was here for was...

404
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:03,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to push back, putting that

405
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:06,535
[SPEAKER_02]: date that he needs, which I get.

406
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:10,230
[SPEAKER_02]: If he's got stuff that he's got to get out for a certain day, then

407
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,234
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do as much as we can to do that.

408
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:19,157
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah i wasn't sure how to handle that because you just tell them no because they do need it especially the payroll what they need by

409
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

410
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:22,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Although,

411
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:23,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about it afterwards.

412
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they do have a workaround.

413
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:28,152
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we can't just run a SQL script and fix it after the fact.

414
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:31,662
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be almost just the same amount of work to just

415
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:36,184
[SPEAKER_00]: do that into payroll and push it out on time.

416
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:41,517
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk with Christian about that on how we...

417
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:44,520
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with things like that.

418
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for the future you can just come on.

419
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:50,764
[SPEAKER_03]: If they tell us what we have to come up with.

420
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:55,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the further in we get with this,

421
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:58,088
[SPEAKER_02]: the more they're gonna think ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking forward to. 

422
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:02,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I was asking.

423
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:07,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we just put an idea for them, like think about here and stuff?

424
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:11,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we've got two or three sprints.

425
00:24:11,838 --> 00:24:13,772
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of in the waiting.

426
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:17,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know about this sales manager thing, but

427
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:21,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that way we can kind of like, 

428
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:26,185
[SPEAKER_00]: iterate through this, like building up to what we eventually want.

429
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,555
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine like once we get to like quarter one of, you know,

430
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:35,550
[SPEAKER_00]: 2026 that's kind of what we'll do like the full thing because you just want this, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: right.

431
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,333
[SPEAKER_00]: to plan out a whole quarter's worth of work from the beginning.

432
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:40,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

433
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:44,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just don't see I don't know how

434
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff and Jordan can think that far ahead.

435
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:53,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's a lot of stuff that they need right now.

436
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:57,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might even just be kind of like, well, here's the thing.

437
00:24:57,316 --> 00:25:00,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the way I kind of see it is like,

438
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:05,672
[SPEAKER_00]: the first sprint is like here's all the stuff that we for sure know that we you know need to do now but then

439
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:11,275
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the second sprint, we're wanting to do this, and the third sprint, we're going to do this.

440
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:14,257
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, you know, it can be changed if needed.

441
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe something that we just build out...

442
00:25:16,553 --> 00:25:21,282
[SPEAKER_02]: sprints based off of ideas they have or what they

443
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:25,348
[SPEAKER_02]: know they're going to need at some point, but then depending on where the

444
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:28,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Priorities lie, those friends can shift around too.

445
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:29,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

446
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:34,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we need to come up with new stuff like

447
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:38,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Maintainability of old apps is getting decreased.

448
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:42,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably have to come up with that.

449
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:46,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's not something they're going to think about.

450
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:49,935
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like, too, that'd be something from, like, you know,

451
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:53,715
[SPEAKER_00]: get through a sprint and we underestimated you know we

452
00:25:53,695 --> 00:25:58,558
[SPEAKER_00]: or overestimated, I mean like we have extra time and we can work on some of that

453
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:03,672
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess for the bigger things, like the logging idea, that would probably be like its own sprint.

454
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:09,291
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah or the rewrite of so

455
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:12,835
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be like a whole year sprint.

456
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Jeff.

457
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:19,011
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't be here in 2026.

458
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:21,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

459
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:22,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty smooth.

460
00:26:23,268 --> 00:26:23,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

461
00:26:25,724 --> 00:26:31,735
[SPEAKER_00]: This process will make it easier to do things like that if we decide we want to rewrite when it's in.

462
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:36,257
[SPEAKER_00]: like to actually break it up into small chunks where we can

463
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:39,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in my...

464
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:42,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was kind of saying with that checks smith stuff,

465
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:49,791
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have time to fit that one in after this sprint, then we fit that one in for the next sprint.

466
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:53,579
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, we'll push it off another string or whatever.

467
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:53,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

468
00:26:56,808 --> 00:27:00,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have access to the sprints now?

469
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:01,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so, yeah.

470
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,645
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it now, right?

471
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:07,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.

472
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:08,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, while I have you guys.

473
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:12,977
[SPEAKER_00]: We were kind of talking about it a little bit yesterday and I wanted to see what your guys' thoughts were.

474
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:17,905
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was kind of thinking about reworking the release pipelines a little bit.

475
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:22,748
[SPEAKER_00]: to where, like the way we're gonna be working on each of these items is we'll each

476
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:25,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on the code side, we're each going to take

477
00:27:25,732 --> 00:27:29,430
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these items and we're going to like make a branch for it and

478
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:34,948
[SPEAKER_00]: do all the work on that and then we'll do a pull request to merge it into like the main branch

479
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:38,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I was thinking about setting it up to do is that

480
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:41,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we do a floor request and that gets completed.

481
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:46,997
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll automatically kick off the build and release straight to DevQC.

482
00:27:46,977 --> 00:27:50,001
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of waiting until the end of this two-week period

483
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:55,688
[SPEAKER_00]: and grouping everything for each app together and then doing one release and then you guys testing it and then coming back

484
00:27:55,668 --> 00:27:58,984
[SPEAKER_00]: This way you guys can kind of test each thing as it comes out.

485
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:01,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you guys feel about that.

486
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine with it.

487
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:05,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine with that.

488
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:06,460
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to add.

489
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that would be more just like for the manual testing side of things and they could do like one day.

490
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:13,898
[SPEAKER_00]: run through like the regression test at the end.

491
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:14,501
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

492
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:17,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a lot of people want to run regression.

493
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytimes or whatever.

494
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:22,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we just do one run through the regression test at the end of this?

495
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what would be best, but...

496
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:28,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, either way would be fine just because I would set up.

497
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:31,294
[SPEAKER_05]: The only downside is right now they're set up to where, like,

498
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:36,643
[SPEAKER_05]: you have one run going it's waiting on approval and if you did another release it wouldn't start that

499
00:28:36,623 --> 00:28:38,105
[SPEAKER_05]: until this one got approval.

500
00:28:38,754 --> 00:28:39,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

501
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:41,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking I kind of have to rework it a little bit.

502
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:45,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have to split up the pipelines to where DevQC is its own.

503
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:49,295
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we can trigger the production release from there.

504
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:50,582
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.

505
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to look at that a little bit, see if there's a better way to do it.

506
00:28:54,086 --> 00:28:55,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like with this,

507
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:59,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Like new process

508
00:28:58,983 --> 00:29:03,930
[SPEAKER_00]: we would be we want to be testing while we're developing so every time we push something

509
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,947
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you guys can start going through it.

510
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:10,950
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just everything all at once at the end.

511
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be fine.

512
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:16,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that way it's fresher in your mind too if I find something

513
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, true.

514
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:21,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we don't just have that bottleneck at the end where

515
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:24,889
[SPEAKER_00]: We're done with everything, but then you guys have to go through it.

516
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:30,880
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, you know, this way it'll be kind of more, once we get to the end, like you just have to test whatever the last thing is, then we're going to go.

517
# Never said 
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,976
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.

518
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:33,883
[SPEAKER_03]: If I

519
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:38,777
[SPEAKER_03]: may ask how the architecture for this pipeline is set right now.

520
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:41,950
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?

521
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,722
[SPEAKER_03]: How is this pipeline set?

522
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:49,257
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that it works right now is, so development system,

523
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:50,001
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline.

524
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:54,606
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the builds happen, development is set to automatically just release those builds

525
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,981
[SPEAKER_00]: for pretty much any branch development, but then for

526
00:29:57,961 --> 00:30:00,985
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, we have to go manually trigger or release.

527
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,242
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a DevQC environment, it deploys to

528
00:30:04,222 --> 00:30:07,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Matt and

529
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:08,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris get notified of that.

530
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:11,267
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go through and kick off all the tests for that.

531
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:12,375
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they're done,

532
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:18,163
[SPEAKER_00]: then we go through and we manually deploy it to QC and approve it to go to production after that.

533
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:24,373
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's best to just have DevQC kind of an automatic thing every time

534
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:30,364
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a pull request is completed into like, I don't know if it would be the development branch or how we decide to structure

535
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:33,283
[SPEAKER_00]: on the code side of things, but...

536
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:44,370
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll kind of look at that and I want you guys to know what I come up with.

537
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:50,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll also try to do some research if we can come up with an efficient rate.

538
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:52,619
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?

539
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:55,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I will also try to do some research about this.

540
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,687
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

541
00:30:56,707 --> 00:31:00,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't looked into our Azure pipelines apart of now.

542
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:03,625
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I will do some research as well.

543
00:31:03,773 --> 00:31:05,904
[SPEAKER_00]: They're voting in their paintings.

544
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:06,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

545
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:12,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I never dealt with Azure, I dealt with AWS and yeah.

546
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:16,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much they should be the same.

547
00:31:16,356 --> 00:31:18,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

548
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:27,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

549
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:29,308
[SPEAKER_07]: See you later.
