1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,050
[SPEAKER_02]: No Jacob, no Chris.

2
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:08,235
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as...

3
00:00:09,616 --> 00:00:11,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Tickets go.

4
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:14,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been fairly quiet.

5
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:18,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been talking to Jordan on some stuff.

6
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:23,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:28,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Blake, he's been working on a few issues with the cabinet order side of things.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess, Andrea, I don't know if they filled you in or not, but we had a

9
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:40,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Issue with the customer portal emails.

10
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:41,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

11
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've been following that.

12
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:46,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Molly's been keeping me posted.

13
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:47,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

14
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:53,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounded like it was just something that Cody did, but I think he's got it fixed now.

15
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:58,202
[SPEAKER_02]: He noticed this morning that they weren't going through again.

16
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:04,497
[SPEAKER_02]: pushed him out and then I guess made another change on the security side to

17
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:06,010
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed those to go through.

18
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:08,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quarantining.

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,867
[SPEAKER_02]: every email that was coming in to...

20
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:18,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it orders at www.inc.com?

21
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:22,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was all emails or not.

22
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:27,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like 90...

23
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:32,003
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just kind of sitting out there waiting to get picked up.

24
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:34,710
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you mention spoofing, is that?

25
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:36,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what it was.

26
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:39,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It was labeling them as, it was spoof.

27
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean are we like changing the to or the from address?

28
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:50,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can spoof emails and you can fake what your address is.

29
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:50,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

30
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:52,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's what it thinks they are.

31
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:55,712
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we're doing that or not.

32
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it probably thinks that they're spoofing.

33
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, them coming into us.

34
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:01,696
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would think.

35
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he was, he was,

36
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,795
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to, I guess, whitelist a

37
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:11,052
[SPEAKER_02]: schism email address that it was using

38
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:16,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And he ended up whitelisting anything that was at www.com.

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what threw it off originally.

40
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

41
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,370
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really...

42
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would it throw it off if you're whitelisting it?

43
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:27,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

44
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:33,816
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't make any sense so is it the orders at wwe yeah email that's the one that was marked as

45
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,369
[SPEAKER_01]: being spooked?

46
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

47
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was just this.

48
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:40,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the customer emails that were coming in.

49
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,042
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're coming in from

50
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:45,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Customer portal.

51
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:50,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be coming in from, I guess, one of our internal emails.

52
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, Andrew?

53
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:54,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when they create an order?

54
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,230
[SPEAKER_03]: That does make sense because basically

55
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:05,220
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the ticketing API works, it basically is scooping the emails

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe because it's getting

57
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:13,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it knows who they are,

58
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:17,677
[SPEAKER_03]: and what their email address is, but they're not actually sending them email.

59
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, that's the program that's sending it.

60
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:23,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're basically seeing who it's from.

61
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:26,601
[SPEAKER_03]: If we send an email, we're putting their address

62
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,415
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is spoofing, but it's a legitimate spoofing.

63
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,283
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they call it spoofing.

64
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to look it up.

65
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:37,266
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a hoax.

66
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:38,987
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, that's exactly what it is.

67
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:43,037
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do it all the time.

68
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,834
[SPEAKER_00]: for work and for play.

69
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:51,458
[SPEAKER_00]: send my brother or my sister emails from

70
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:55,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed McMahon, you want a million dollars?

71
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:03,304
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that all the time on emails and seeing your spam folder all the time.

72
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:08,755
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go and you hover over the address that it says it's from and it's something else.

73
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:14,982
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of looking for it again because after you pushed out the

74
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:17,985
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like 20 or so sitting in quarantine this morning.

75
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:21,342
[SPEAKER_02]: and then he made another change and it wasn't performable.

76
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:23,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's fixed.

77
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:24,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

78
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:31,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've been working on a few issues with

79
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:35,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Cameron Norder trying to diagnose some oddball.

80
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:40,969
[SPEAKER_02]: issues that they've been having.

81
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the one thing I really have to get

82
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:46,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be out tomorrow.

83
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:49,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not having my procedure tomorrow, but

84
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm not having my procedure, I'm gonna do what I was originally planning,

85
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:56,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going.

86
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: place I was going.

87
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:05,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna take the day and just spend it with the littles.

88
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:12,745
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to try and get that email out if you can.

89
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think all we need to really do on that one

90
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,743
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to look into the rehire.

91
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:23,899
[SPEAKER_02]: just to make sure that it's putting in the right date there.

92
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,949
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're a rehire, make sure that it's putting the rehire date in.

93
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,278
[SPEAKER_02]: as the start date or whatever.

94
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everything else, I think we just need to make sure that it's

95
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,952
[SPEAKER_02]: that last export date is being set.

96
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:44,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Which that works differently for just not like how it is with the medical where we just set that date and

97
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:50,089
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to create a bunch of dummy records as if they've been exported.

98
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,105
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have been exporting periodically, but like the

99
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:57,733
[SPEAKER_02]: The last day that I sent one of those change files,

100
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:02,070
[SPEAKER_02]: is I assume what we want that day to be set through.

101
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if we deleted the export from that or if we just marked it.

102
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:07,424
[SPEAKER_01]: has not finalized it.

103
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:12,229
[SPEAKER_01]: If the record's still there, all we gotta do is just set that as the most recent one, and then we'll be good.

104
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,175
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one was an actual export.

105
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:16,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

106
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:16,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the script.

107
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we'll probably have to still insert the records.

108
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:22,472
[SPEAKER_02]: We can look back and see what the records show.

109
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:24,785
[SPEAKER_02]: because I know what date that was.

110
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:27,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like July 8th or something.

111
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:31,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can look back and see what the closest line is if we want to do that.

112
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that'll...

113
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:39,178
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll clean up their discrepancies.

114
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:43,752
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, they weren't using this to compare to production at all.

115
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:49,270
[SPEAKER_02]: they were just comparing it to the format like is are we getting everything we need

116
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,125
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we say, okay, it's good, then we start in production.

117
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:58,197
[SPEAKER_02]: they were actually comparing it to production.

118
00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:01,200
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't going to line up because we're going

119
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,267
[SPEAKER_02]: have some that are that have been terminated that they're not going to have in their system

120
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,815
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just going to drop off of our test file.

121
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:09,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just try and get it.

122
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:12,439
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll send this next one as it

123
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:19,459
[SPEAKER_02]: could be the production file, the first one.

124
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

125
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:27,819
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everything going on your end?

126
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a few...

127
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:35,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I've got a lot of those label issues fixed.

128
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just kind of random things down.

129
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:42,578
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the

130
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot the name.

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,792
[SPEAKER_02]: The phone thing or the emergency thing.

132
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:55,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think we're going to add the new building.

133
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:59,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday, I think that's what their plan is.

134
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

135
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:02,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's all over there.

136
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:03,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they get fans yet?

137
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:07,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I think they've got a couple.

138
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:10,945
[SPEAKER_02]: One at least, I know, in that area.

139
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:14,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about those big old fans.

140
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:19,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a difference for sure.

141
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they're calling the building eclipse.

142
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:24,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

143
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:25,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

144
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the other one Shiloh?

145
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know I guess so.

146
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:33,388
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Jenny said and that's what they called it in the

147
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:38,198
[SPEAKER_02]: InformaCast and Label and Eclipse.

148
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,204
[SPEAKER_00]: But Charlotte's going to be moving over there, right?

149
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:42,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

150
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:43,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess so.

151
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:44,205
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the plan.

152
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:48,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to Corey about it and he didn't, he was kind of weirded out about it too because

153
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:50,687
[SPEAKER_02]: It's eventually going to be Shiloh, but... Right.

154
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Because eventually an aspect of it, right?

155
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:55,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.

156
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:58,498
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have some name changes later, I don't know.

157
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:00,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that's easy to do.

158
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:05,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go in there and, okay, this building's that, this building, okay, done.

159
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:12,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's very easy in the network because they have to do subnets.

160
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:14,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right, yeah.

161
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:18,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how they have them named.

162
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,242
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've named them generically, then it shouldn't be a problem.

163
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:26,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

164
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:31,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We should just go with like building, bigger building, bigger building.

165
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Building A, Building B, Building C.

166
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,792
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run out of letters, you've got your company too big.

167
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:45,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, you got anything interesting right now?

168
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you have a couple cabin order ones that are...

169
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:55,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I tested the changes he did and everything seemed good, so I'm just running the rest of the tests to make sure nothing else

170
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:59,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we pushed that one out at two yesterday and everything seemed fine.

171
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:06,252
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit after this meeting, we'll be sending you a Checksmith.

172
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:07,828
[SPEAKER_01]: to test.

173
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:10,656
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally wrapped up yesterday.

174
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:16,647
[SPEAKER_01]: got an actual bank statement file from Jordan and we ran it through both side by side and everything worked.

175
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:17,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

176
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:20,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're done.

177
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:24,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we all, did we figure out the whole like new ACH?

178
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:29,640
[SPEAKER_01]: No, last I heard Jordan,

179
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:34,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to where I could figure out how to

180
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:38,179
[SPEAKER_01]: recreate the file he had been sending them, we have like,

181
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,637
[SPEAKER_01]: options to change all that in the accounting program.

182
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:43,579
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that point, Jordan said, I guess

183
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,169
[SPEAKER_01]: the bank that they're working with had reached out to like another

184
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:53,485
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're associated with that was gonna see if they could process the ACH for them.

185
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:57,274
[SPEAKER_01]: The way we head with the old place.

186
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess.

187
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:03,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they could at least provide some more info on why our ECH wasn't working.

188
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard anything, it's been like a week.

189
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:11,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And did I hear he called about the 401k change?

190
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:12,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

191
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:15,760
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to make a change

192
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,776
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said it's not until October, and all we have to do is just add

193
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:24,028
[SPEAKER_01]: an extra column onto the file that they export.

194
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:27,332
[SPEAKER_01]: That just has if employees are part-time or not.

195
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,386
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it sounds like we'll have to do.

196
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:29,648
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

197
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:34,390
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they'll need a one-time

198
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,112
[SPEAKER_01]: to import everybody, or if that's something they could just transfer between the companies.

199
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I assume they can, since they're

200
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:43,907
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing over all of the amount and all that stuff.

201
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,582
[SPEAKER_01]: which means function alone.

202
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:53,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

203
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:01,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I will fill you guys in.

204
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: moving forward and we'll talk about this a little bit more on Monday when everybody's here

205
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:12,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursdays, Scott's gonna start running meetings because

206
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:16,412
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gonna get more technical with it.

207
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:18,805
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gonna show...

208
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:23,007
[SPEAKER_02]: more of the boards and we'll go through how

209
00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:27,630
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to standardize things or try to.

210
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:34,380
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's going to take the lead on coordinating all of the PR he has.

211
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,835
[SPEAKER_02]: coordinated to all the triage type stuff.

212
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,965
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want to get some stuff in place that

213
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:50,783
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can go off of to make sure that stuff doesn't go stale or make sure that

214
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:55,575
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff is getting out in a reasonable time and we're

215
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:58,579
[SPEAKER_02]: to a place where we can start

216
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,545
[SPEAKER_02]: learning, documenting things to take stuff off of your plate.

217
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:05,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of what this Thursday meeting is going to be about is

218
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:10,258
[SPEAKER_02]: just, it's going to be ticket based.

219
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Mondays will be just

220
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:14,632
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we gonna be trying to push out for the week?

221
00:13:15,498 --> 00:13:16,265
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we working on?

222
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:17,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

223
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:23,065
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the Thursday one we'll just focus on tickets, which we kind of do already.

224
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:28,532
[SPEAKER_02]: But he'll get more detailed and we'll still keep it as short as we can.

225
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Just...

226
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,755
[SPEAKER_02]: but that'll take one thing off of my plate.

227
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,221
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to do it.

228
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,695
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got like over 200 issues out there now.

229
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:44,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Really all we're trying to do is keep it from getting stale.

230
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:46,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep it current.

231
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:52,191
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's one reason if you guys have seen the periodic emails coming through with

232
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:57,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the ones that have been over a year, that just haven't been touched yet.

233
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:02,552
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had any of those, you'll get an automated email once a month.

234
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:06,957
[SPEAKER_00]: First of every month they should come through.

235
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:10,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plan is, once those are

236
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:13,690
[SPEAKER_00]: either commented, the status has changed, or just

237
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,503
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's updated them in some way to say, yes, I know that's here.

238
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:22,633
[SPEAKER_00]: then that'll fall off the list and as that gets smaller,

239
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:26,498
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can reduce that time back to a more reasonable

240
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:28,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a year is kind of a long time.

241
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,257
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll kind of feel that out.

242
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:36,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Well another thing that we have been talking about too

243
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:44,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are based off of anything that's active, right?

244
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:49,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, if it hasn't been

245
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:53,717
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's not closed, resolved,

246
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:58,577
[SPEAKER_00]: and there has been no updates in 365 days.

247
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:04,365
[SPEAKER_00]: An update could be anything from a status change to a comment or

248
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Assigning it to someone for that matter.

249
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:14,659
[SPEAKER_02]: But so we can mess around with some of the statuses too and that monitoring status

250
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,701
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have in Jura.

251
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:22,388
[SPEAKER_02]: if we flip it to monitoring, like if there's a ticket that

252
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:26,539
[SPEAKER_02]: may or may not ever get done.

253
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be something that they would like to have, but it's not

254
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,521
[SPEAKER_02]: ever going to end up at the top of the list.

255
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We could set that to monitoring, which will put it on hold in DevOps.

256
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:44,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can have a bucket of those, so I can free it up.

257
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,536
[SPEAKER_02]: a time where we're just looking for stuff.

258
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:50,063
[SPEAKER_02]: We can look on those on hold and then flip them back to active winter.

259
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:56,053
[SPEAKER_00]: We could even explore some of the priorities on there as far as

260
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:58,753
[SPEAKER_00]: if something is lowest priority,

261
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:03,580
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be something else we could trigger off of.

262
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:06,702
[SPEAKER_00]: low or lowest priorities might have a different

263
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:10,330
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold and high level.

264
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,772
[SPEAKER_00]: or highest priority or medium priority.

265
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:17,756
[SPEAKER_00]: we could experiment with those thresholds and throw that into that query pretty easy.

266
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and really, I mean,

267
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,066
[SPEAKER_02]: when we were putting some of those boards together just to show

268
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:29,382
[SPEAKER_02]: what's out there, we were just focused on highs just because we know that they need those.

269
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:33,330
[SPEAKER_02]: but the mediums most of the time are

270
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,887
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty well needed also.

271
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:42,983
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the Thursday meetings will go.

272
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:46,088
[SPEAKER_02]: streamline it.

273
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:51,775
[SPEAKER_02]: get it to where they're more visible to us and like i said we're just trying to take some

274
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,348
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the pressure off of you guys.

275
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:56,533
[SPEAKER_02]: That way we keep eyes on it if you can.

276
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:02,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't get caught off guard when somebody calls in and goes, hey, what's this?

277
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,363
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, I haven't heard of that.

278
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:05,832
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

279
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when someone's out, like this week, we've got a lot of people out.

280
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:16,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Jordan doesn't like whenever me and Chris are both happy.

281
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, he was not happy that day.

282
00:17:19,953 --> 00:17:20,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't really help.

283
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:21,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily.

284
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:23,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, luckily.

285
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Because originally I was supposed to be out all this week and I didn't know that Chris was going to be out also.

286
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:34,249
[SPEAKER_02]: That worked out kind of, although he called on Monday when I was out.

287
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,290
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that calendar on the triage board, so that helps.

288
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,558
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep that updated.

289
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:44,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I need a new one.

290
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

291
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:51,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew you got anything fun?

292
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:58,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one fun thing and one semi, exciting thing.

293
00:17:58,715 --> 00:18:00,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think this is fun.

294
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:05,046
[SPEAKER_03]: but people have been discovering

295
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:08,657
[SPEAKER_03]: hogs, wild hogs in California.

296
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:12,014
[SPEAKER_03]: When they open them up, they have neon blue meat.

297
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,648
[SPEAKER_03]: All their meat looks like Smurf color.

298
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:18,478
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the top layer of it does.

299
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,056
[SPEAKER_03]: and it turns out that

300
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:27,490
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a hog poison which is basically just a strong

301
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:33,480
[SPEAKER_03]: rat poison and to prevent people from

302
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,227
[SPEAKER_03]: basically getting secondhand poisoning.

303
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:43,217
[SPEAKER_03]: they put a strong dye in it so that when the hogs eat the meat,

304
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:48,617
[SPEAKER_03]: they will be like solid blue and apparently it gives them green tea too.

305
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:50,153
[SPEAKER_03]: but, um,

306
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I didn't know that was a thing.

307
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:53,716
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.

308
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:56,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Yellow and blue make green.

309
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Ann is...

310
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:04,497
[SPEAKER_03]: just warframe, which is an anti-clodian agent that people take.

311
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:10,572
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's just a very strong dose that kills rats and I guess hogs.

312
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:13,508
[SPEAKER_03]: The...

313
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:20,680
[SPEAKER_03]: We were debating on the web team if there was no prisoner involved

314
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,898
[SPEAKER_03]: but you've just managed to get that blue dye into somebody's food,

315
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:28,813
[SPEAKER_03]: would they turn like Smurf blue?

316
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:31,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like you'd have to eat a lot of it.

317
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:33,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

318
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:40,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And the semi-exciting fact is the CHAP GBT-5 is supposed to be released

319
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:46,127
[SPEAKER_03]: at noon, but only for people paying the $200 a month thing.

320
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:51,342
[SPEAKER_03]: they're gonna roll it out to other people in like the next two weeks.

321
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:54,024
[SPEAKER_00]: That's neat.

322
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:57,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I used ChetGPT yesterday to

323
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,320
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to see what it would do.

324
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,492
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started feeding it dump files and graphs and all sorts of things.

325
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:05,607
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really surprised.

326
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:09,010
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty spot on with what Blake has been telling me.

327
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,251
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the problems with the application I'm testing.

328
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:14,747
[SPEAKER_00]: It flagged just about every one of them.

329
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:20,738
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good, it's recognizing what a person does.

330
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:24,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I was impressed.

331
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,272
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really known what to do with a dump file either.

332
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw it into...

333
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:35,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Visual Studio and look at it and I still really don't completely understand what I'm looking at.

334
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:37,976
[SPEAKER_00]: The GPT is able to explain it.

335
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:39,756
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty neat.

336
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:45,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and the thing about turning blue.

337
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:48,683
[SPEAKER_00]: When my daughter was...

338
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:50,111
[SPEAKER_00]: in a high chair.

339
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,470
[SPEAKER_00]: She loved carrots and sweet potatoes.

340
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,083
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about all she would eat.

341
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:57,137
[SPEAKER_00]: She literally turned orange.

342
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:01,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've had a couple orange babies before.

343
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew, what do you know about

344
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:10,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is going back to my test on Monday.

345
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:14,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get there and

346
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:21,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, so all I knew about stress tests was I got to get on the treadmill and they got to monitor me.

347
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

348
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta see what my heart's doing when I'm stressed.

349
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they give me an IV as soon as I get there.

350
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:34,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And say we're going to inject you with this nuclear

351
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:36,942
[SPEAKER_02]: substance.

352
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what?

353
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuclear sounds bad.

354
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:48,015
[SPEAKER_02]: after I had to sit there for an hour,

355
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:51,559
[SPEAKER_02]: for I guess it to go through my system

356
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they get readings on it or whatever because they sent me through another

357
00:21:56,939 --> 00:22:02,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like an MRI machine that just watches it, but it all glows inside of you.

358
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:06,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they watch in the thing that's going around you.

359
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:10,965
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said, oh, it's just a low dose of,

360
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:15,026
[SPEAKER_02]: You're clear, whatever.

361
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:16,011
Stay closed.

362
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:20,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It still doesn't sound good.

363
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Next fact, I want to know more about this nuclear die.

364
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:27,964
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever it is.

365
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:28,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like to imagine

366
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:34,962
[SPEAKER_01]: that the stress test, you're like on the treadmill and there's just like an army drill sergeant screaming in your ear the whole time.

367
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:36,606
[SPEAKER_01]: She was an old lady.

368
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:37,965
[SPEAKER_02]: She was great.

369
00:22:37,945 --> 00:22:43,585
[SPEAKER_02]: other than when she was taking all the stickers off of me she was not gentle

370
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:46,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought I did great.

371
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on there for like six minutes.

372
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the doctor comes in and he said, you didn't last very long on the treadmill.

373
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:54,891
[SPEAKER_02]: She stopped it.

374
00:22:54,871 --> 00:23:00,797
[SPEAKER_02]: My heart wasn't liking it, but I was doing fine.

375
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:05,674
[SPEAKER_02]: They took me off, I guess, when the pressure got up too high.

376
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:10,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But.

377
00:23:11,982 --> 00:23:16,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew Graham next, hopefully next Friday is my assumption.

378
00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:17,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Assumption.

379
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,688
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how much we have now.

380
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:26,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thanks guys.

381
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,739
[SPEAKER_00]: At least you got to do the treadmill.

382
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't.

383
00:23:31,102 --> 00:23:32,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't do the treadmill.

384
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:34,841
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom didn't get on it either.

385
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:37,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, did they do the chemicals?

386
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:38,144
[SPEAKER_00]: stress test on her.

387
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, they just took her blood pressure in.

388
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:45,246
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a chemical stress test on my mom.

389
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:46,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard about those.

390
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:48,028
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought I was getting.

391
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:48,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

392
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:50,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't know.

393
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:51,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd rather do the treadmill.

394
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:56,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I did something about laying in bed and then my heart just taken off would be really unsettling.

395
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was kind of glad I did this trip.

396
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:03,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't hard.

397
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,656
[SPEAKER_02]: just walking, just raised and lowered.
