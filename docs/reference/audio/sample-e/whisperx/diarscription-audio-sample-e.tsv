31	4050	No Jacob, no Chris.
5093	8235	As far as...
9616	11007	Tickets go.
11571	14192	It's been fairly quiet.
14172	18394	You've been talking to Jordan on some stuff.
18374	23119	And then...
23723	28620	Blake, he's been working on a few issues with the cabinet order side of things.
29630	35488	And then I guess, Andrea, I don't know if they filled you in or not, but we had a
35468	40821	Issue with the customer portal emails.
41037	41699	Yeah.
42809	45043	Yeah, I've been following that.
45063	46915	Molly's been keeping me posted.
46935	47740	Okay, cool.
48277	53072	Yeah, it sounded like it was just something that Cody did, but I think he's got it fixed now.
53677	58202	He noticed this morning that they weren't going through again.
58773	64497	pushed him out and then I guess made another change on the security side to
64477	66010	allowed those to go through.
66051	68310	It was quarantining.
68290	72867	every email that was coming in to...
73538	78351	Or is it orders at www.inc.com?
78331	82587	I don't know if it was all emails or not.
83461	87565	So there's like 90...
88253	92003	They were just kind of sitting out there waiting to get picked up.
91983	94710	I heard you mention spoofing, is that?
94751	96306	Yeah, that's what it was.
96286	99310	It was labeling them as, it was spoof.
99290	104102	I mean are we like changing the to or the from address?
104993	110188	Well, you can spoof emails and you can fake what your address is.
110268	110852	Right.
110832	112607	I guess that's what it thinks they are.
112627	115712	I don't know if we're doing that or not.
116047	118104	I think it probably thinks that they're spoofing.
118830	121028	Oh, them coming into us.
121008	121696	That's what I would think.
121717	123559	Cause he was, he was,
124130	127795	supposed to, I guess, whitelist a
127775	131052	schism email address that it was using
131032	136890	And he ended up whitelisting anything that was at www.com.
136870	140856	So that's what threw it off originally.
140836	142336	I don't know.
142357	143370	It doesn't really...
144312	146674	Why would it throw it off if you're whitelisting it?
146917	147825	I don't know.
147805	153816	it doesn't make any sense so is it the orders at wwe yeah email that's the one that was marked as
153796	155369	being spooked?
155389	157043	I don't think so.
157063	158575	I think it was just this.
158555	160625	Yeah, the customer emails that were coming in.
161489	164042	But they're coming in from
164022	165932	Customer portal.
167195	170937	So that would be coming in from, I guess, one of our internal emails.
171239	172345	Right, Andrew?
172325	174252	Like when they create an order?
174890	179230	That does make sense because basically
179210	185220	The way the ticketing API works, it basically is scooping the emails
185200	188764	I believe because it's getting
188744	193455	Basically, it knows who they are,
193435	197677	and what their email address is, but they're not actually sending them email.
197697	199446	Right, that's the program that's sending it.
199426	203158	So we're basically seeing who it's from.
203138	206601	If we send an email, we're putting their address
206581	210415	So it is spoofing, but it's a legitimate spoofing.
211205	213283	That's why they call it spoofing.
213719	216178	I had to look it up.
216198	217266	It's like a hoax.
217415	218987	It is, that's exactly what it is.
219168	223037	I used to do it all the time.
223287	226834	for work and for play.
226814	231458	send my brother or my sister emails from
232113	235862	Ed McMahon, you want a million dollars?
238795	243304	You see that all the time on emails and seeing your spam folder all the time.
243284	248755	And you go and you hover over the address that it says it's from and it's something else.
251114	254982	It's kind of looking for it again because after you pushed out the
254962	257985	There was like 20 or so sitting in quarantine this morning.
257965	261342	and then he made another change and it wasn't performable.
261363	263976	So I think it's fixed.
263956	264669	Thank you.
266757	271553	Yeah, we've been working on a few issues with
271533	275805	Cameron Norder trying to diagnose some oddball.
276646	280969	issues that they've been having.
281692	284715	And then the one thing I really have to get
284695	286674	I will be out tomorrow.
286957	289238	I'm not having my procedure tomorrow, but
289690	293912	Since I'm not having my procedure, I'm gonna do what I was originally planning,
295732	296917	I'm not going.
299731	300837	place I was going.
302003	305742	I'm gonna take the day and just spend it with the littles.
305722	305806	Thank you.
306953	312745	But I do want to try and get that email out if you can.
313130	317200	And I think all we need to really do on that one
317720	320743	We need to look into the rehire.
320723	323899	just to make sure that it's putting in the right date there.
323879	327949	If they're a rehire, make sure that it's putting the rehire date in.
327929	330278	as the start date or whatever.
330730	335560	And then everything else, I think we just need to make sure that it's
335540	338952	that last export date is being set.
338932	344672	Which that works differently for just not like how it is with the medical where we just set that date and
344652	350089	We'll have to create a bunch of dummy records as if they've been exported.
350069	354105	because they have been exporting periodically, but like the
354997	357733	The last day that I sent one of those change files,
358017	362070	is I assume what we want that day to be set through.
362050	366238	I can't remember if we deleted the export from that or if we just marked it.
366218	367424	has not finalized it.
367444	372229	If the record's still there, all we gotta do is just set that as the most recent one, and then we'll be good.
372209	375175	But that one was an actual export.
375236	376023	Oh, yeah, that's right.
376043	376971	Yeah, that was the script.
376951	379329	Yeah, so we'll probably have to still insert the records.
379651	382472	We can look back and see what the records show.
382452	384785	because I know what date that was.
384805	387298	It was like July 8th or something.
387278	391483	So we can look back and see what the closest line is if we want to do that.
392240	394318	Because I think that'll...
394957	399178	that'll clean up their discrepancies.
400002	403752	In my mind, they weren't using this to compare to production at all.
403732	409270	they were just comparing it to the format like is are we getting everything we need
409250	415125	and then we say, okay, it's good, then we start in production.
415105	418197	they were actually comparing it to production.
418177	421200	isn't going to line up because we're going
421180	425267	have some that are that have been terminated that they're not going to have in their system
425247	427815	They're just going to drop off of our test file.
428234	429964	So we'll just try and get it.
430206	432439	We'll send this next one as it
433448	439459	could be the production file, the first one.
439439	443104	Um...
445784	447819	How's everything going on your end?
448061	449230	I've seen a few...
449210	455220	Yeah, I think I've got a lot of those label issues fixed.
455200	460435	Yeah, it's just kind of random things down.
460853	462578	How's the
466760	469820	I forgot the name.
469840	471792	The phone thing or the emergency thing.
472109	475352	Oh, I think we're going to add the new building.
475805	479100	Friday, I think that's what their plan is.
479120	479908	Okay, cool.
479888	482375	So yeah, that's all over there.
482698	483992	Did they get fans yet?
484394	487671	Oh, yeah, I think they've got a couple.
487651	490945	One at least, I know, in that area.
491313	494742	Let me talk about those big old fans.
495464	499163	It makes a difference for sure.
500206	502268	I guess they're calling the building eclipse.
503227	504112	Really?
505218	505339	Yeah.
505359	507410	Is the other one Shiloh?
507430	509119	I don't know I guess so.
509504	513388	That's what Jenny said and that's what they called it in the
513368	518198	InformaCast and Label and Eclipse.
519089	521204	But Charlotte's going to be moving over there, right?
521768	522352	I don't know.
522493	523319	Yeah, I guess so.
523339	524205	That's the plan.
524185	528677	I was talking to Corey about it and he didn't, he was kind of weirded out about it too because
528657	530687	It's eventually going to be Shiloh, but... Right.
531310	533622	Because eventually an aspect of it, right?
533602	535677	Yeah, I think so.
535798	538498	We may have some name changes later, I don't know.
538478	540591	Hopefully that's easy to do.
541668	545957	Let's go in there and, okay, this building's that, this building, okay, done.
548485	552649	I don't think it's very easy in the network because they have to do subnets.
553112	554057	Oh, right, yeah.
556585	558518	It just depends on how they have them named.
558659	562242	If they've named them generically, then it shouldn't be a problem.
563099	566224	Yeah.
567436	571540	We should just go with like building, bigger building, bigger building.
571520	574830	Building A, Building B, Building C.
574810	579792	If you run out of letters, you've got your company too big.
581425	585141	Chris, you got anything interesting right now?
585458	588330	I know you have a couple cabin order ones that are...
589289	595165	Yeah, I tested the changes he did and everything seemed good, so I'm just running the rest of the tests to make sure nothing else
595145	599400	Yeah, we pushed that one out at two yesterday and everything seemed fine.
600798	606252	A little bit after this meeting, we'll be sending you a Checksmith.
606232	607828	to test.
607848	610656	We finally wrapped up yesterday.
610636	616647	got an actual bank statement file from Jordan and we ran it through both side by side and everything worked.
616627	617436	Great.
617456	620308	So, we're done.
620288	624645	Did we all, did we figure out the whole like new ACH?
624625	629640	No, last I heard Jordan,
629873	634585	I got to where I could figure out how to
634565	638179	recreate the file he had been sending them, we have like,
638159	640637	options to change all that in the accounting program.
641544	643579	But at that point, Jordan said, I guess
643559	648169	the bank that they're working with had reached out to like another
648723	653485	that they're associated with that was gonna see if they could process the ACH for them.
653465	657274	The way we head with the old place.
657294	658362	Yeah, I guess.
658342	663660	Or if they could at least provide some more info on why our ECH wasn't working.
663640	666512	I haven't heard anything, it's been like a week.
667454	671932	And did I hear he called about the 401k change?
671952	672537	Yeah.
672517	675760	We're going to have to make a change
675740	679776	But he said it's not until October, and all we have to do is just add
679756	684028	an extra column onto the file that they export.
684008	687332	That just has if employees are part-time or not.
687352	689386	That's all it sounds like we'll have to do.
689406	689648	That's good.
691366	694390	I don't know if they'll need a one-time
694370	698112	to import everybody, or if that's something they could just transfer between the companies.
698534	700043	Which I assume they can, since they're
700023	703907	bringing over all of the amount and all that stuff.
705760	708582	which means function alone.
712325	713830	Um...
718012	721086	I will fill you guys in.
721066	727077	moving forward and we'll talk about this a little bit more on Monday when everybody's here
727057	732342	Thursdays, Scott's gonna start running meetings because
733334	736412	He's gonna get more technical with it.
737397	738805	He's gonna show...
739325	743007	more of the boards and we'll go through how
742987	747630	we're going to standardize things or try to.
748589	754380	but he's going to take the lead on coordinating all of the PR he has.
754360	758835	coordinated to all the triage type stuff.
760300	763965	We just want to get some stuff in place that
764772	770783	that we can go off of to make sure that stuff doesn't go stale or make sure that
770763	775575	stuff is getting out in a reasonable time and we're
775555	778579	to a place where we can start
778559	782545	learning, documenting things to take stuff off of your plate.
782525	785869	So that's kind of what this Thursday meeting is going to be about is
785849	790258	just, it's going to be ticket based.
790279	791708	Mondays will be just
791688	794632	What are we gonna be trying to push out for the week?
795498	796265	What are we working on?
796285	797091	Whatever.
797071	803065	But then the Thursday one we'll just focus on tickets, which we kind of do already.
803045	808532	But he'll get more detailed and we'll still keep it as short as we can.
808512	810000	Just...
811280	815755	but that'll take one thing off of my plate.
816173	817221	I'm happy to do it.
817584	821695	We've got like over 200 issues out there now.
822147	824305	Really all we're trying to do is keep it from getting stale.
825131	826200	Just keep it current.
826180	832191	and that's one reason if you guys have seen the periodic emails coming through with
832171	837625	Like the ones that have been over a year, that just haven't been touched yet.
837605	842552	If you had any of those, you'll get an automated email once a month.
842532	846957	First of every month they should come through.
846937	850045	And the plan is, once those are
850025	853690	either commented, the status has changed, or just
853670	857503	somebody's updated them in some way to say, yes, I know that's here.
858192	862633	then that'll fall off the list and as that gets smaller,
862613	866498	then we can reduce that time back to a more reasonable
866478	868374	Because a year is kind of a long time.
869483	871257	So we'll kind of feel that out.
871237	876420	Well another thing that we have been talking about too
879472	884368	So those are based off of anything that's active, right?
884348	889498	Well, yeah, if it hasn't been
890626	893717	if it's not closed, resolved,
893697	898577	and there has been no updates in 365 days.
898912	904365	An update could be anything from a status change to a comment or
904666	908668	Assigning it to someone for that matter.
908648	914659	But so we can mess around with some of the statuses too and that monitoring status
914639	916701	that we have in Jura.
917373	922388	if we flip it to monitoring, like if there's a ticket that
923515	926539	may or may not ever get done.
926519	930420	It may be something that they would like to have, but it's not
930400	934521	ever going to end up at the top of the list.
935480	939735	We could set that to monitoring, which will put it on hold in DevOps.
939985	944460	And then we can have a bucket of those, so I can free it up.
944440	946536	a time where we're just looking for stuff.
946556	950063	We can look on those on hold and then flip them back to active winter.
950043	956053	We could even explore some of the priorities on there as far as
956033	958753	if something is lowest priority,
960421	963580	that could be something else we could trigger off of.
963982	966702	low or lowest priorities might have a different
967306	970330	threshold and high level.
970310	973772	or highest priority or medium priority.
973752	977756	we could experiment with those thresholds and throw that into that query pretty easy.
977797	979527	Yeah, and really, I mean,
979979	984066	when we were putting some of those boards together just to show
984046	989382	what's out there, we were just focused on highs just because we know that they need those.
989362	993330	but the mediums most of the time are
994070	997887	pretty well needed also.
998558	1002983	That's what the Thursday meetings will go.
1002963	1006088	streamline it.
1006878	1011775	get it to where they're more visible to us and like i said we're just trying to take some
1011755	1013348	some of the pressure off of you guys.
1013408	1016533	That way we keep eyes on it if you can.
1018353	1022313	And we don't get caught off guard when somebody calls in and goes, hey, what's this?
1022815	1024363	We're like, I haven't heard of that.
1024343	1025832	All right.
1027330	1031687	Especially when someone's out, like this week, we've got a lot of people out.
1032545	1036047	Yeah, Jordan doesn't like whenever me and Chris are both happy.
1036168	1038100	Oh yeah, he was not happy that day.
1039953	1040702	Can't really help.
1040722	1041127	Luckily.
1042018	1043010	Yeah, luckily.
1042990	1048798	Because originally I was supposed to be out all this week and I didn't know that Chris was going to be out also.
1050601	1054249	That worked out kind of, although he called on Monday when I was out.
1056440	1060290	We got that calendar on the triage board, so that helps.
1060270	1061558	We keep that updated.
1062222	1064678	Yeah, I need a new one.
1068050	1070237	Okay.
1070257	1071512	Andrew you got anything fun?
1072403	1078363	I have one fun thing and one semi, exciting thing.
1078715	1080912	Well, I think this is fun.
1081381	1085046	but people have been discovering
1085026	1088657	hogs, wild hogs in California.
1088637	1092014	When they open them up, they have neon blue meat.
1092175	1094648	All their meat looks like Smurf color.
1094628	1098478	At least the top layer of it does.
1098458	1102056	and it turns out that
1102036	1107490	there is a hog poison which is basically just a strong
1107470	1113480	rat poison and to prevent people from
1113460	1117227	basically getting secondhand poisoning.
1117207	1123217	they put a strong dye in it so that when the hogs eat the meat,
1123197	1128617	they will be like solid blue and apparently it gives them green tea too.
1128597	1130153	but, um,
1131061	1133093	Yeah, so I didn't know that was a thing.
1133133	1133716	That makes sense.
1134118	1136532	Yellow and blue make green.
1136782	1138827	Ann is...
1139228	1144497	just warframe, which is an anti-clodian agent that people take.
1144814	1150572	but it's just a very strong dose that kills rats and I guess hogs.
1151395	1153508	The...
1155749	1160680	We were debating on the web team if there was no prisoner involved
1160660	1164898	but you've just managed to get that blue dye into somebody's food,
1164878	1168813	would they turn like Smurf blue?
1169114	1171650	Seems like you'd have to eat a lot of it.
1172636	1173522	Yeah.
1174126	1180137	And the semi-exciting fact is the CHAP GBT-5 is supposed to be released
1180117	1186127	at noon, but only for people paying the $200 a month thing.
1186107	1191342	they're gonna roll it out to other people in like the next two weeks.
1192132	1194024	That's neat.
1194044	1197788	I used ChetGPT yesterday to
1197768	1199320	I just wanted to see what it would do.
1199360	1203492	So I started feeding it dump files and graphs and all sorts of things.
1203472	1205607	And I was really surprised.
1205667	1209010	It was pretty spot on with what Blake has been telling me.
1208990	1212251	a lot of the problems with the application I'm testing.
1212855	1214747	It flagged just about every one of them.
1214727	1220738	That's pretty good, it's recognizing what a person does.
1220718	1224045	I was impressed.
1224515	1227272	I've never really known what to do with a dump file either.
1227292	1229344	I throw it into...
1229999	1235470	Visual Studio and look at it and I still really don't completely understand what I'm looking at.
1236074	1237976	The GPT is able to explain it.
1238967	1239756	It's pretty neat.
1242757	1245891	Oh, and the thing about turning blue.
1247016	1248683	When my daughter was...
1249405	1250111	in a high chair.
1250696	1252470	She loved carrots and sweet potatoes.
1252510	1254083	That's about all she would eat.
1254063	1257137	She literally turned orange.
1257893	1261862	Yeah, we've had a couple orange babies before.
1263395	1266773	Andrew, what do you know about
1267259	1270536	Okay, this is going back to my test on Monday.
1270516	1274434	So I get there and
1275106	1281066	Well, okay, so all I knew about stress tests was I got to get on the treadmill and they got to monitor me.
1281046	1282440	Right?
1282460	1285369	Gotta see what my heart's doing when I'm stressed.
1286159	1290313	Well, they give me an IV as soon as I get there.
1290293	1294195	And say we're going to inject you with this nuclear
1294175	1296942	substance.
1296962	1298295	I was like, what?
1298630	1302413	Nuclear sounds bad.
1302393	1308015	after I had to sit there for an hour,
1307995	1311559	for I guess it to go through my system
1311539	1316115	Then they get readings on it or whatever because they sent me through another
1316939	1322494	Almost like an MRI machine that just watches it, but it all glows inside of you.
1322474	1326156	And that's what they watch in the thing that's going around you.
1326929	1330965	But I said, oh, it's just a low dose of,
1330945	1335026	You're clear, whatever.
1335509	1336011	Stay closed.
1335991	1340415	It still doesn't sound good.
1340800	1345191	Next fact, I want to know more about this nuclear die.
1345525	1347964	or whatever it is.
1348024	1348971	I just like to imagine
1348951	1354962	that the stress test, you're like on the treadmill and there's just like an army drill sergeant screaming in your ear the whole time.
1354942	1356606	She was an old lady.
1356768	1357965	She was great.
1357945	1363585	other than when she was taking all the stickers off of me she was not gentle
1363852	1366133	Yeah, I thought I did great.
1366497	1368495	I was on there for like six minutes.
1368880	1373343	And then the doctor comes in and he said, you didn't last very long on the treadmill.
1374127	1374891	She stopped it.
1374871	1380797	My heart wasn't liking it, but I was doing fine.
1380777	1385674	They took me off, I guess, when the pressure got up too high.
1390109	1390636	But.
1391982	1396034	Andrew Graham next, hopefully next Friday is my assumption.
1396054	1397284	Assumption.
1397855	1401688	That's how much we have now.
1403187	1406953	Okay, thanks guys.
1406933	1410739	At least you got to do the treadmill.
1410760	1411122	I didn't.
1411102	1412549	Couldn't do the treadmill.
1413052	1414841	My mom didn't get on it either.
1414861	1417112	Yeah, did they do the chemicals?
1417092	1418144	stress test on her.
1418164	1420774	Nope, they just took her blood pressure in.
1420754	1425246	They did a chemical stress test on my mom.
1425226	1426456	Yeah, I've heard about those.
1426476	1428028	That's what I thought I was getting.
1428048	1428975	Oh, yeah.
1428955	1430051	I'm like, I don't know.
1430092	1431979	I think I'd rather do the treadmill.
1431959	1436822	I did something about laying in bed and then my heart just taken off would be really unsettling.
1438895	1441580	Yeah, I was kind of glad I did this trip.
1442165	1443336	It wasn't hard.
1444042	1447656	just walking, just raised and lowered.
