1 00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,050 SPEAKER_00: No Conrad, no Jacob, no Chris.
2 00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:08,235 SPEAKER_00: As far as...
3 00:00:09,616 --> 00:00:11,007 SPEAKER_00: Tickets go.
4 00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:14,192 SPEAKER_00: It's been fairly quiet.
5 00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:18,394 SPEAKER_00: I know you've been talking to Jordan on some stuff.
6 00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:23,119 SPEAKER_00: And then...
7 00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:28,620 SPEAKER_00: Blake, he's been working on a few issues with the cabinet order side of things.
8 00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,488 SPEAKER_00: And then I guess, Andrew, I don't know if they filled you in or not, but we had a
9 00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:40,821 SPEAKER_00: Issue with the customer portal emails.
10 00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:41,699 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
11 00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,043 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I've been following that.
12 00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:46,915 SPEAKER_01: Molly's been keeping me posted.
13 00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:47,740 SPEAKER_00: Okay, cool.
14 00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:53,072 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it sounded like it was just something that Cody did, but I think he's got it fixed now.
15 00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:58,202 SPEAKER_00: He noticed this morning that they weren't going through again.
16 00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:04,497 SPEAKER_00: And pushed him out and then I guess made another change on the security side to
17 00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:06,010 SPEAKER_00: allowed those to go through.
18 00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:08,310 SPEAKER_00: He was quarantining.
19 00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,867 SPEAKER_00: every email that was coming in to...
20 00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:18,351 SPEAKER_00: Or is it orders at wwwinc.com?
21 00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:22,587 SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it was all emails or not.
22 00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:27,565 SPEAKER_00: So there's like 90 orders
23 00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:32,003 SPEAKER_00: They were just kind of sitting out there waiting to get picked up.
24 00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:34,710 SPEAKER_02: I heard you mention spoofing, is that?
25 00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:36,306 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's what it was.
26 00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:39,310 SPEAKER_00: It was labeling them as, it was spoof.
27 00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,102 SPEAKER_02: I mean are we like changing the to or the from address?
28 00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:50,188 SPEAKER_03: Well, you can like spoof emails and you can like fake what your address is and send emails.
29 00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:50,852 SPEAKER_02: Right.
30 00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:52,607 SPEAKER_03: I guess that's what it thinks they are.
31 00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:55,712 SPEAKER_02: I don't know if we're doing that or not.
32 00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,104 SPEAKER_03: I think it probably thinks that they're spoofing.
33 00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,028 SPEAKER_02: Oh, them coming into us.
34 00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:01,696 SPEAKER_03: That's what I would think.
35 00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,559 SPEAKER_00: Cause he was, he was,
36 00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,795 SPEAKER_00: supposed to, I guess, whitelist a
37 00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:11,052 SPEAKER_00: schism email address that it was using
38 00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:16,890 SPEAKER_00: And he ended up whitelisting anything that was at www.com.
39 00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,856 SPEAKER_00: So that's what threw it off originally.
40 00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,336 SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
41 00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,370 SPEAKER_00: It doesn't really make sense to me.
42 00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,674 SPEAKER_02: Why would it throw it off if you're whitelisting it?
43 00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:27,825 SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
44 00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:33,816 SPEAKER_02: It doesn't make any sense.
44 00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:33,816 SPEAKER_00: It doesn't make sense to me either.
44 00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:33,816 SPEAKER_03: So is it the orders at WW inc?
44 00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:33,816 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
45 00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,369 SPEAKER_03: The ww email, that's the one that was marked as being spooked?
45 00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,369 SPEAKER_02: Huh.
46 00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,043 SPEAKER_00: I don't think so.
47 00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,575 SPEAKER_00: I think it was...
48 00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:40,625 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the customer emails that were coming in.
49 00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,042 SPEAKER_00: But they're coming in from
50 00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:45,932 SPEAKER_00: Customer portal.
51 00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:50,937 SPEAKER_00: So that would be coming in from, I guess, one of our internal emails.
52 00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,345 SPEAKER_00: Right, Andrew?
53 00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:54,252 SPEAKER_00: Like when they create an order?
54 00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,230 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that does make sense because basically
55 00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:05,220 SPEAKER_01: The way the ticketing API works, it basically is spoofing the emails
56 00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,764 SPEAKER_01: I believe because it's getting
57 00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:13,455 SPEAKER_01: Basically, it knows who they are,
58 00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:17,677 SPEAKER_01: and what their email address is, but they're not actually sending them emails.
59 00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,446 SPEAKER_00: Right, that's the program that's sending it.
60 00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:23,158 SPEAKER_01: So we're basically seeing who it's from.
61 00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:26,601 SPEAKER_01: When we send an email, we're putting their address
62 00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,415 SPEAKER_01: So it is spoofing, but it's a legitimate spoofing.
63 00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,283 SPEAKER_00: That's why they call it spoofing.
64 00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,178 SPEAKER_00: I had to look it up.
65 00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:37,266 SPEAKER_00: Spoof is like a hoax.
66 00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:38,987 SPEAKER_02: It is, that's exactly what it is.
67 00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:43,037 SPEAKER_02: I used to do it all the time.
68 00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,834 SPEAKER_02: for work and for play.
69 00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:51,458 SPEAKER_02: send my brother or my sister emails from
70 00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:55,862 SPEAKER_02: Ed McMahon, you won a million dollars!
71 00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:03,304 SPEAKER_02: You see that all the time on emails and seeing your spam folder all the time.
72 00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:08,755 SPEAKER_02: And you go and you hover over the address that it says it's from and it's something else.
73 00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:14,982 SPEAKER_00: It sounds like it's working again because after you pushed out the
74 00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:17,985 SPEAKER_00: There was like 20 or so sitting in quarantine this morning.
75 00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:21,342 SPEAKER_00: and then he made another change and it wasn't performable.
76 00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:23,976 SPEAKER_00: So I think it's fixed.
77 00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:24,669 SPEAKER_00:
78 00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:31,553 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we've been working on a few issues with
79 00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:35,805 SPEAKER_00: Cabinet Order trying to diagnose some oddball.
80 00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:40,969 SPEAKER_00: issues that they've been having.
81 00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,715 SPEAKER_00: And then the one thing I really have to get done...
82 00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:46,674 SPEAKER_00: I will be out tomorrow.
83 00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:49,238 SPEAKER_00: I'm not having my procedure tomorrow, but
84 00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,912 SPEAKER_00: Since I'm not having my procedure, I'm gonna do what I was originally planning,
85 00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:56,917 SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to the.
86 00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:00,837 SPEAKER_00: place I was going.
87 00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:05,742 SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna take the day and just spend it with the littles.
88 00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:12,745 SPEAKER_00: But I do want to try and get that email out if you can.
88 00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:12,745 SPEAKER_03: Okay. Yep.
89 00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,200 SPEAKER_00: And I think all we need to really do on that one
90 00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,743 SPEAKER_00: We need to look into the rehire.
91 00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:23,899 SPEAKER_00: just to make sure that it's putting in the right date there.
92 00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,949 SPEAKER_00: If they're a rehire, make sure that it's putting the rehire date in.
93 00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,278 SPEAKER_00: as the start date or whatever.
94 00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,560 SPEAKER_00: And then everything else, I think we just need to make sure that it's
95 00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,952 SPEAKER_00: that last export date is being set.
96 00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:44,672 SPEAKER_03: Which that works differently for just not like how it is with the medical where we just set that date
97 00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:50,089 SPEAKER_03: We'll have to create a bunch of dummy records as if they've been exported.
98 00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,105 SPEAKER_00: because they have been exporting periodically, but like the
99 00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:57,733 SPEAKER_00: The last day that I sent one of those change files,
100 00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:02,070 SPEAKER_00: is I assume what we want that day to be set through.
101 00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,238 SPEAKER_03: I can't remember if we deleted the export from that or if we just marked it.
102 00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:07,424 SPEAKER_03: It has not finalized it.
103 00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:12,229 SPEAKER_03: If the record's still there, all we gotta do is just set that as the most recent one, and then we'll be good.
104 00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,175 SPEAKER_00: But that one was an actual export.
105 00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:16,023 SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah, that's right.
106 00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:16,971 SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that was the script.
107 00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,329 SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so we'll probably have to still insert the records.
108 00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:22,472 SPEAKER_00: We can look back and see what the records show.
109 00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:24,785 SPEAKER_00: because I know what date that was.
110 00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:27,298 SPEAKER_00: It was like July 8th or something.
111 00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:31,483 SPEAKER_00: So we can look back and see what the closest one is if we want to do that.
112 00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,318 SPEAKER_00: Because I think that'll...
113 00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:39,178 SPEAKER_00: that'll clean up their discrepancies.
114 00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:43,752 SPEAKER_00: In my mind, they weren't using this to compare to production at all.
115 00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:49,270 SPEAKER_00: they were just comparing it to the format like is are we getting everything we need
116 00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,125 SPEAKER_00: and then we say, okay, it's good, then we start in production.
117 00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:58,197 SPEAKER_00: they were actually comparing it to production.
118 00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:01,200 SPEAKER_00: isn't going to line up because we're going
119 00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,267 SPEAKER_00: have some that are that have been terminated that they're not going to have in their system
120 00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,815 SPEAKER_00: They're just going to drop off of our test file.
121 00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:09,964 SPEAKER_00: So we'll just try and get it.
122 00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:12,439 SPEAKER_00: We'll send this next one as it
123 00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:19,459 SPEAKER_00: could be the production file, the first one.
124 00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,104 SPEAKER_00: Um...
125 00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:27,819 SPEAKER_00: How's everything going on your end?
126 00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,230 SPEAKER_00: I've seen a few...
127 00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:35,220 SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think I've got a lot of those label issues fixed.
127 00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:35,220 SPEAKER_00: Okay, good.
128 00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,435 SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's just kind of random things down.
128 00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,435 SPEAKER_00: Okay.
129 00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:42,578 SPEAKER_00: How's the
130 00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,820 SPEAKER_00: I forgot the name.
131 00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,792 SPEAKER_00: The phone thing or the emergency thing.
132 00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:55,352 SPEAKER_04: Oh, I think we're going to add the new building.
133 00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:59,100 SPEAKER_04: Friday, I think that's what their plan is.
134 00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,908 SPEAKER_00: Okay, cool.
135 00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:02,375 SPEAKER_04: So yeah, that's all over there.
136 00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:03,992 SPEAKER_04: Did they get fans yet?
137 00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:07,671 SPEAKER_04: Fans, oh yeah, I think they've got a couple.
138 00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:10,945 SPEAKER_04: One at least, I know, in that area.
139 00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:14,742 SPEAKER_02: You talking about those big old fans.
140 00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:19,163 SPEAKER_00: It makes a difference for sure.
140 00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:19,163 SPEAKER_04: Oh yeah, for sure.
141 00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,268 SPEAKER_04: I guess they're calling the building eclipse.
142 00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:24,112 SPEAKER_00: Really?
143 00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:25,339 SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
144 00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,410 SPEAKER_00: Is the other one Shiloh?
145 00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,119 SPEAKER_04: I don't know I guess so.
146 00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:33,388 SPEAKER_04: That's what Jenny said and that's what they called it in the
147 00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:38,198 SPEAKER_04: InformaCast and labelled it Eclipse.
148 00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,204 SPEAKER_02: But Shiloh's going to be moving over there, right?
149 00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:42,352 SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
150 00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:43,319 SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I guess so.
151 00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:44,205 SPEAKER_04: That's the plan.
152 00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:48,677 SPEAKER_04: I was talking to Corey about it and he didn't, he was kind of weirded out about it too because
153 00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:50,687 SPEAKER_04: It's eventually going to be Shiloh, but...
153 00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:50,687 SPEAKER_00: Right.
154 00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,622 SPEAKER_00: Because eventually Aspect is moving, right?
155 00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:55,677 SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think so.
156 00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:58,498 SPEAKER_04: We may have some name changes later, I don't know.
157 00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:00,591 SPEAKER_02: Hopefully that's easy to do.
158 00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:05,957 SPEAKER_02: Let's go in there and, okay, this building's that, this building, okay, done.
159 00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:12,649 SPEAKER_04: I don't think it's very easy in the network because they have to do subnets.
160 00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:14,057 SPEAKER_02: Oh, right, yeah.
161 00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:18,518 SPEAKER_02: It just depends on how they have them named.
162 00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,242 SPEAKER_02: If they've named them generically, then it shouldn't be a problem.
163 00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:26,224 SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
163 00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:26,224 SPEAKER_04: We'll see.
164 00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:31,540 SPEAKER_01: We should just go with like building, bigger building, bigger building.
165 00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,830 SPEAKER_02: Building A, Building B, Building C.
166 00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,792 SPEAKER_02: If you run out of letters, you've got your company too big.
167 00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:45,141 SPEAKER_00: Chris, you got anything interesting right now?
168 00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,330 SPEAKER_00: I know you have a couple cabinet order ones that are...
169 00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:55,165 SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I tested the changes he did and everything seemed good, so I'm just running the rest of the tests to make sure nothing else is broken.
170 00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:59,400 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we pushed that one out at 2 yesterday and everything seemed fine.
171 00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:06,252 SPEAKER_03: A little bit after this meeting, we'll be sending you a Checksmith.
172 00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:07,828 SPEAKER_03: to test.
173 00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:10,656 SPEAKER_03: We finally wrapped up yesterday.
174 00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:16,647 SPEAKER_03: We got an actual bank statement file from Jordan and we ran it through both side by side and everything worked.
175 00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:17,436 SPEAKER_03: Great.
176 00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:20,308 SPEAKER_03: So, we're done.
177 00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:24,645 SPEAKER_00: Did we all, did we figure out the whole like new ACH issue?
178 00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:29,640 SPEAKER_03: No, last I heard Jordan, I was actually...
179 00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:34,585 SPEAKER_03: I got to where I could figure out how to
180 00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:38,179 SPEAKER_03: recreate the file he had been sending them, we have like,
181 00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,637 SPEAKER_03: options to change all that in the accounting program.
182 00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:43,579 SPEAKER_03: But at that point, Jordan said, I guess
183 00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,169 SPEAKER_03: the bank that they're working with had reached out to like another bank
184 00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:53,485 SPEAKER_03: that they're associated with that was gonna see if they could process the ACH for them.
185 00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:57,274 SPEAKER_00: The way we head with the old place.
186 00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,362 SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I guess.
187 00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:03,660 SPEAKER_03: Or if they could at least provide some more info on why our ECH wasn't working.
188 00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,512 SPEAKER_03: I haven't heard anything, it's been like a week.
188 00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,512 SPEAKER_00: Okay.
189 00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:11,932 SPEAKER_00: And did I hear he called about the 401k change?
190 00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:12,537 SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
191 00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:15,760 SPEAKER_03: We're going to have to make a change in payroll
192 00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,776 SPEAKER_03: But he said it's not until October, and all we have to do is just add
193 00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:24,028 SPEAKER_03: an extra column onto the file that they export.
194 00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:27,332 SPEAKER_03: That just has if employees are part-time or not.
195 00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,386 SPEAKER_03: That's all it sounds like we'll have to do.
196 00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:29,648 SPEAKER_00: That's good.
197 00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:34,390 SPEAKER_03: I don't know if they'll need a one-time thing
198 00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,112 SPEAKER_03: to import everybody, or if that's something they could just transfer between the companies.
199 00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,043 SPEAKER_03: Which I assume they can, since they're
200 00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:43,907 SPEAKER_03: bringing over all of the amount and all that stuff.
201 00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,582 SPEAKER_03: which means...
201 00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,582 SPEAKER_00: I'm sure they'll call us.
202 00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:53,830 SPEAKER_00: Um...
203 00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:01,086 SPEAKER_00: I will fill you guys in.
204 00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:07,077 SPEAKER_00: moving forward and we'll talk about this a little bit more on Monday when everybody's here
205 00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:12,342 SPEAKER_00: Thursdays, Scott's gonna start running meetings because
206 00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:16,412 SPEAKER_00: He's gonna get more technical with it.
207 00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:18,805 SPEAKER_00: He's gonna show...
208 00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:23,007 SPEAKER_00: more of the boards and we'll go through how
209 00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:27,630 SPEAKER_00: we're going to standardize things or try to.
210 00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:34,380 SPEAKER_00: but he's going to take the lead on coordinating all of the PR he has.
211 00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,835 SPEAKER_00: coordinated to all the triage type stuff.
212 00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,965 SPEAKER_00: We just want to get some stuff in place that
213 00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:50,783 SPEAKER_00: that we can go off of to make sure that stuff doesn't go stale or make sure that
214 00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:55,575 SPEAKER_00: stuff is getting out in a reasonable time and we're getting
215 00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:58,579 SPEAKER_00: to a place where we can start
216 00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,545 SPEAKER_00: learning, documenting things to take stuff off of your plate.
217 00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:05,869 SPEAKER_00: So that's kind of what this Thursday meeting is going to be about is
218 00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:10,258 SPEAKER_00: just, it's going to be ticket based.
219 00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,708 SPEAKER_00: Mondays will be just
220 00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:14,632 SPEAKER_00: What are we gonna be trying to push out for the week?
221 00:13:15,498 --> 00:13:16,265 SPEAKER_00: What are we working on?
222 00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:17,091 SPEAKER_00: Whatever.
223 00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:23,065 SPEAKER_00: But then the Thursday one we'll just focus on tickets, which we kind of do already.
224 00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:28,532 SPEAKER_00: But he'll get more detailed and we'll still keep it as short as we can.
225 00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:30,000 SPEAKER_00: Just...
226 00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,755 SPEAKER_00: but that'll take one thing off of my plate.
227 00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,221 SPEAKER_02: I'm happy to do it.
227 00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,221 SPEAKER_00: Right.
228 00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,695 SPEAKER_02: We've got like over 200 issues out there now.
228 00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,695 SPEAKER_00: Yep.
229 00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:44,305 SPEAKER_02: Really all we're trying to do is keep it from getting stale.
229 00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:44,305 SPEAKER_00: Yep.
230 00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:46,200 SPEAKER_02: Just keep it current.
231 00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:52,191 SPEAKER_00: and that's one reason if you guys have seen the periodic emails coming through with
232 00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:57,625 SPEAKER_00: Like the ones that have been over a year
232 00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:57,625 SPEAKER_02: Yep.
232 00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:57,625 SPEAKER_00: that just haven't been touched yet.
233 00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:02,552 SPEAKER_00: If you had any of those, you'll get an automated email once a month.
234 00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:06,957 SPEAKER_02: First of every month they should come through.
235 00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:10,045 SPEAKER_02: And the plan is, once those are
236 00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:13,690 SPEAKER_02: either commented, the status has changed, or just
237 00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,503 SPEAKER_02: somebody's updated them in some way to say, yes, I know that's here.
238 00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:22,633 SPEAKER_02: then that'll fall off the list and as that gets smaller,
239 00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:26,498 SPEAKER_02: then we can reduce that time back to a more reasonable
240 00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:28,374 SPEAKER_02: Because a year is kind of a long time.
241 00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,257 SPEAKER_02: So we'll kind of feel that out.
242 00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:36,420 SPEAKER_00: Well another thing that we have been talking about too
243 00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:44,368 SPEAKER_00: So those are based off of anything that's active, right, or assigned, I guess?
244 00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:49,498 SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah, if it hasn't been
245 00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:53,717 SPEAKER_00: If it's not closed.
245 00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:53,717 SPEAKER_02: if it's not closed, resolved,
246 00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:58,577 SPEAKER_02: and there has been no updates in 365 days.
247 00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:04,365 SPEAKER_02: An update could be anything from a status change to a comment or
248 00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,668 SPEAKER_02: Assigning it to someone for that matter.
249 00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:14,659 SPEAKER_00: But so we've been messing around with some of the statuses too and that monitoring status
250 00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,701 SPEAKER_00: that we have in Jira.
251 00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:22,388 SPEAKER_00: if we flip it to monitoring, like if there's a ticket that
252 00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:26,539 SPEAKER_00: may or may not ever get done.
253 00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,420 SPEAKER_00: It may be something that they would like to have, but it's not
254 00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,521 SPEAKER_00: ever going to end up at the top of the list.
255 00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,735 SPEAKER_00: We could set that to monitoring, which will put it on hold in DevOps.
256 00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:44,460 SPEAKER_00: And then we can have a bucket of those, so I can free it up.
257 00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,536 SPEAKER_00: a time where we're just looking for stuff.
258 00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:50,063 SPEAKER_00: We can look on those on hold and then flip them back to active whenever we want.
259 00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:56,053 SPEAKER_02: We could even explore some of the priorities on there as far as
260 00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:58,753 SPEAKER_02: if something is lowest priority,
261 00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:03,580 SPEAKER_02: that could be something else we could trigger off of.
261 00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:03,580 SPEAKER_00: Right.
262 00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:06,702 SPEAKER_02: low or lowest priorities might have a different
263 00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:10,330 SPEAKER_02: threshold and high level.
264 00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,772 SPEAKER_02: or highest priority or medium priority.
265 00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:17,756 SPEAKER_02: we could experiment with those thresholds and throw that into that query pretty easy.
266 00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,527 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and really, I mean,
267 00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,066 SPEAKER_00: when we were putting some of those boards together just to show
268 00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:29,382 SPEAKER_00: what's out there, we were just focused on highs just because we know that they need those.
269 00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:33,330 SPEAKER_00: but the mediums most of the time are
270 00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,887 SPEAKER_00: pretty well needed also.
271 00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:42,983 SPEAKER_00: That's what the Thursday meetings will go.
272 00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:46,088 SPEAKER_00: Try to streamline it.
273 00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:51,775 SPEAKER_00: get it to where they're more visible to us and like i said we're just trying to take some
274 00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,348 SPEAKER_00: some of the pressure off of you guys.
275 00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:56,533 SPEAKER_00: That way we keep eyes on it if you can't.
276 00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:02,313 SPEAKER_02: And we don't get caught off guard when somebody calls in and goes, hey, what's this?
277 00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,363 SPEAKER_02: We're like, I haven't heard of that.
278 00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:05,832 SPEAKER_00: All right.
279 00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,687 SPEAKER_02: Especially when someone's out, like this week, we've got a lot of people out.
280 00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:16,047 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Jordan doesn't like whenever me and Chris are both out.
281 00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,100 SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah, he was not happy that day.
282 00:17:19,953 --> 00:17:20,702 SPEAKER_03: Can't really help it.
283 00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:21,127 SPEAKER_00: Luckily.
284 00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:23,010 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, luckily.
285 00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,798 SPEAKER_00: Because originally I was supposed to be out all this week and I didn't know that Chris was going to be out also.
286 00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:34,249 SPEAKER_00: That worked out kind of, although he called on Monday when I was out.
287 00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,290 SPEAKER_02: We got that calendar on the triage board, so that helps.
288 00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,558 SPEAKER_02: We keep that updated.
289 00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:44,678 SPEAKER_00: I need to send you a new one.
289 00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:44,678 SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I need a new one.
290 00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,237 SPEAKER_00: Okay.
291 00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:51,512 SPEAKER_00: Andrew you got anything fun?
292 00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:58,363 SPEAKER_01: I have one fun thing and one semi, exciting thing.
293 00:17:58,715 --> 00:18:00,912 SPEAKER_01: Well, I think this is fun.
294 00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:05,046 SPEAKER_01: but people have been discovering
295 00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:08,657 SPEAKER_01: hogs, wild hogs in California.
296 00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:12,014 SPEAKER_01: When they open them up, they have neon blue meat.
297 00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,648 SPEAKER_01: All their meat looks like Smurf color.
298 00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:18,478 SPEAKER_01: At least the top layer of it does.
299 00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,056 SPEAKER_01: and it turns out that
300 00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:27,490 SPEAKER_01: there is a hog poison which is basically just a strong
301 00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:33,480 SPEAKER_01: rat poison and to prevent people from
302 00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,227 SPEAKER_01: basically getting secondhand poisoning.
303 00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:43,217 SPEAKER_01: they put a strong dye in it so that when the hogs eat the meat,
304 00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:48,617 SPEAKER_01: they will be like solid blue and apparently it gives them green pee too.
305 00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:50,153 SPEAKER_01: but, um,
306 00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,093 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so I didn't know that was a thing.
307 00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:53,716 SPEAKER_00: That makes sense.
308 00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:56,532 SPEAKER_00: Yellow and blue make green.
309 00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,827 SPEAKER_01: And this...
310 00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:04,497 SPEAKER_01: just warfarin, which is an anti-clodian agent that people take.
311 00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:10,572 SPEAKER_01: but it's just a very strong dose that kills rats and I guess hogs.
312 00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:13,508 SPEAKER_01: The...
313 00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:20,680 SPEAKER_01: We were debating on the web team if there was no poison involved
314 00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,898 SPEAKER_01: but you've just managed to get that blue dye into somebody's food,
315 00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:28,813 SPEAKER_01: would they turn like Smurf blue?
316 00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:31,650 SPEAKER_02: Seems like you'd have to eat a lot of it.
317 00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:33,522 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
318 00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:40,137 SPEAKER_01: And the semi-exciting fact is the CHAP GPT-5 is supposed to be released
319 00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:46,127 SPEAKER_01: at noon, but only for people paying the $200 a month thing.
320 00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:51,342 SPEAKER_01: they're gonna roll it out to other people in like the next two weeks.
321 00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:54,024 SPEAKER_02: That's neat.
322 00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:57,788 SPEAKER_02: I used ChatGPT yesterday to
323 00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,320 SPEAKER_02: I just wanted to see what it would do.
324 00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,492 SPEAKER_02: So I started feeding it dump files and graphs and all sorts of things.
325 00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:05,607 SPEAKER_02: And I was really surprised.
326 00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:09,010 SPEAKER_02: It was pretty spot on with what Blake has been telling me.
327 00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,251 SPEAKER_02: a lot of the problems with the application I'm testing.
328 00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:14,747 SPEAKER_02: It flagged just about every one of them.
329 00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:20,738 SPEAKER_02: That's pretty good, it's recognizing what a person does.
329 00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:20,738 SPEAKER_01: It's learning.
330 00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:24,045 SPEAKER_02: I was impressed.
331 00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,272 SPEAKER_02: I've never really known what to do with a dump file either.
332 00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,344 SPEAKER_02: I throw it into...
333 00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:35,470 SPEAKER_02: Visual Studio and look at it and I still really don't completely understand what I'm looking at.
334 00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:37,976 SPEAKER_02: But GPT is able to explain it.
335 00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:39,756 SPEAKER_02: It's pretty neat.
335 00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:39,756 SPEAKER_00: Oh, Andrew...
336 00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:45,891 SPEAKER_02: Oh, and the thing about turning blue.
337 00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:48,683 SPEAKER_02: When my daughter was...
338 00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:50,111 SPEAKER_02: in a high chair.
339 00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,470 SPEAKER_02: She loved carrots and sweet potatoes.
340 00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,083 SPEAKER_02: That's about all she would eat.
341 00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:57,137 SPEAKER_02: She literally turned orange.
342 00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:01,862 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we've had a couple orange babies before.
343 00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,773 SPEAKER_00: Andrew, what do you know about
344 00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:10,536 SPEAKER_00: Okay, this is going back to my test on Monday.
345 00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:14,434 SPEAKER_00: So I get there and they...
346 00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:21,066 SPEAKER_00: Well, okay, so all I knew about stress tests was I got to get on the treadmill and they got to monitor me.
347 00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,440 SPEAKER_00: Right?
348 00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,369 SPEAKER_00: Gotta see what my heart's doing when I'm stressed.
349 00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,313 SPEAKER_00: Well, they give me an IV as soon as I get there.
350 00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:34,195 SPEAKER_00: And say we're going to inject you with this nuclear
351 00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:36,942 SPEAKER_00: substance.
352 00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,295 SPEAKER_00: I was like, what?
353 00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,413 SPEAKER_00: Nuclear sounds bad.
354 00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:48,015 SPEAKER_00: after I had to sit there for an hour,
355 00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:51,559 SPEAKER_00: for I guess it to go through my system
356 00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,115 SPEAKER_00: Then they get readings on it or whatever because they sent me through another
357 00:21:56,939 --> 00:22:02,494 SPEAKER_00: Almost like an MRI machine that just watches it, but it all glows inside of you.
358 00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:06,156 SPEAKER_00: And that's what they watch in the thing that's going around you.
359 00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:10,965 SPEAKER_00: But I said, oh, it's just a low dose of,
360 00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:15,026 SPEAKER_00: Nuclear, whatever.
361 00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:16,011 SPEAKER_00:
362 00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:20,415 SPEAKER_00: It still doesn't sound good.
363 00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,191 SPEAKER_00: So next fact, I want to know more about this nuclear dye.
364 00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:27,964 SPEAKER_00: or whatever it is.
365 00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:28,971 SPEAKER_03: I just like to imagine
366 00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:34,962 SPEAKER_03: that the stress test, you're like on the treadmill and there's just like an army drill sergeant screaming in your ear the whole time.
367 00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:36,606 SPEAKER_00: It was an old lady.
368 00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:37,965 SPEAKER_00: She was great.
369 00:22:37,945 --> 00:22:43,585 SPEAKER_00: other than when she was taking all the stickers off of me she was not gentle
370 00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:46,133 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I thought I did great.
371 00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,495 SPEAKER_00: I was on there for like six minutes.
372 00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,343 SPEAKER_00: And then the doctor comes in and he said, you didn't last very long on the treadmill.
373 00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:54,891 SPEAKER_00: She stopped it.
374 00:22:54,871 --> 00:23:00,797 SPEAKER_00: My heart wasn't liking it, but I was doing fine.
375 00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:05,674 SPEAKER_00: They took me off, I guess, when the pressure got up too high.
376 00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:10,636 SPEAKER_00: But.
377 00:23:11,982 --> 00:23:16,034 SPEAKER_00: Andrew next, hopefully next Friday is my assumption.
378 00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:17,284 SPEAKER_00: Assumption.
379 00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,688 SPEAKER_00: I'll let you guys know.
380 00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:26,953 SPEAKER_00: Okay, thanks guys.
381 00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,739 SPEAKER_02: At least you got to do the treadmill.
382 00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,122 SPEAKER_00: I did.
383 00:23:31,102 --> 00:23:32,549 SPEAKER_02: My mom couldn't do the treadmill.
384 00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:34,841 SPEAKER_00: My mom didn't get on it either.
385 00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:37,112 SPEAKER_02: Yeah, did they do the chemicals.
386 00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:38,144 SPEAKER_02: stress test on her?
387 00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,774 SPEAKER_00: Nope, they just took her blood pressure in.
387 00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,774 SPEAKER_06: She was out within 10 seconds.
388 00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:45,246 SPEAKER_02: They did a chemical stress test on my mom.
389 00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:46,456 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I've heard about those.
390 00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:48,028 SPEAKER_00: That's what I thought I was getting.
391 00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:48,975 SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.
392 00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:50,051 SPEAKER_02: I'm like, I don't know.
393 00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:51,979 SPEAKER_02: I think I'd rather do the treadmill.
394 00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:56,822 SPEAKER_02: Something about laying in bed and then my heart just taken off would be really unsettling.
395 00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,580 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I was kind of glad I did this trip.
396 00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:03,336 SPEAKER_00: It wasn't hard.
397 00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,656 SPEAKER_00: just walking, just raised and lowered.
