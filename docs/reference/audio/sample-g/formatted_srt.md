1 00:00:01,364 --> 00:00:02,279 SPEAKER_00:
2 00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:18,951 SPEAKER_00:
3 00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,648 SPEAKER_00: Conrad needs to hurry back and get that clock adjusted again.
4 00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,146 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's a little off.
5 00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,533 SPEAKER_02: Just a few minutes.
5 00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,533 SPEAKER_00: Better than what it could be.
6 00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:52,718 SPEAKER_02: We almost try to set the one at church a little faster.
7 00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:56,920 SPEAKER_02: So the pastor gets done quicker.
7 00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:56,920 SPEAKER_00: There you go.
8 00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:00,075 SPEAKER_00: Especially during football season.
9 00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:06,893 SPEAKER_03: Are you referring to the clock that is inside the clock text?
10 00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:09,559 SPEAKER_03: That is off too.
11 00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:09,701 SPEAKER_00: Is it?
12 00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:09,964 SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
13 00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:12,850 SPEAKER_03: It is.
14 00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:13,553 SPEAKER_02: On Zoom?
15 00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,046 SPEAKER_03: No, I mean the wall clock.
16 00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,895 SPEAKER_03: The clock text is a little bit off.
17 00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:21,642 SPEAKER_00: Just a tad bit.
18 00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,607 SPEAKER_00: There's a big gap between five and six, six and the seven
19 00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:32,188 SPEAKER_06: Maybe we should have bought a better clock.
20 00:01:32,168 --> 00:01:34,066 SPEAKER_06: I think they're going for the gimmick.
21 00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:36,508 SPEAKER_06: Because of the word clock at the top middle.
22 00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:41,098 SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it is like there's a bump between L.O.C.
23 00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,661 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, just get one of those projector ones for the table and it just.
24 00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:45,587 SPEAKER_00: shoots up there.
25 00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,726 SPEAKER_05: Hi folks, I'm sorry I'm a little late.
26 00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:52,962 SPEAKER_01: You are not late compared to our clock.
27 00:01:52,942 --> 00:01:56,624 SPEAKER_02: We were just discussing that.
28 00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:57,670 SPEAKER_01: Right on time.
29 00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,180 SPEAKER_01: Hello Krishna, everyone. Everyone, Krishna.

73 00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,538 SPEAKER_05: But if there's something written up somewhere that you have
74 00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,287 SPEAKER_01: We can write that up for you.
75 00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:25,107 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we can do that.
76 00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,735 SPEAKER_01: Krishna, do you want to say anything about yourself at all?
77 00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:31,992 SPEAKER_05: I'll just quickly introduce myself from my background.
78 00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:37,780 SPEAKER_05: I started out my career as a software developer way back at Oracle.
79 00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,492 SPEAKER_05: And then that was right after grad school.
80 00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,333 SPEAKER_05: Where I finished my computer science master's.
81 00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,441 SPEAKER_05: And then I decided I was going to work at Oracle.
82 00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:49,204 SPEAKER_05: It was a great place to be and practice all the software.
83 00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:53,946 SPEAKER_05: back then, you know, practices that I learned in grad school and all that.
84 00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:57,017 SPEAKER_05: After that, I decided I wanted to work at
85 00:04:57,301 --> 00:05:02,687 SPEAKER_05: small medium-sized companies and I have since then worked at many different companies
86 00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:08,678 SPEAKER_05: I also got an MBA and moved away from software engineering software development.
87 00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,947 SPEAKER_05: into more the client side of the business where
88 00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:17,993 SPEAKER_05: You talk to customers, you talk to users of your software,
89 00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:22,195 SPEAKER_05: You figure out what the pin points are, and then you
90 00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:25,975 SPEAKER_05: then I would go talk to the engineering teams and say,
91 00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,409 SPEAKER_05: Here's the requirements.
92 00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,772 SPEAKER_05: That's broadly speaking what I do.
93 00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:34,345 SPEAKER_05: But there's a lot more of that to the product function.
94 00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:39,171 SPEAKER_05: The thing that is most relevant here is
95 00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:44,520 SPEAKER_05: Since about 2013, I have been involved in
96 00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,515 SPEAKER_05: Agile teams and agile means
97 00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,238 SPEAKER_05: many different things to
98 00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:56,569 SPEAKER_05: every company that tries to practice it.
99 00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:59,573 SPEAKER_05: And there's many variations of
100 00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:05,344 SPEAKER_05: There is no correct agile leverage from what I have seen in my
101 00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:08,567 SPEAKER_05: 14 years of doing this.
102 00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:11,571 SPEAKER_05: But it's really something that, you know,
103 00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:15,402 SPEAKER_05: you adopt and it works for your
104 00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:19,485 SPEAKER_05: internal team, as well as your clients that you serve.
105 00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:21,860 SPEAKER_05: finance is probably one client.
106 00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:25,341 SPEAKER_05: There's many other clients in your company.
107 00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:30,387 SPEAKER_05: So, but the key elements of this is trying to,
108 00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:33,390 SPEAKER_05: For all our additional conversations,
109 00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,790 SPEAKER_05: that we had last time, it seems like there's a little frustration in the minds of finance
110 00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,663 SPEAKER_05: in terms of what they are getting versus what they thought they asked for.
111 00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:47,579 SPEAKER_05: There's a gap, it seems like.
112 00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:50,333 SPEAKER_05: And what I've...
113 00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:53,539 SPEAKER_05: experienced prior, and on
114 00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,830 SPEAKER_05: teams is the product function.
115 00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,943 SPEAKER_05: the product manager, my role is really to be the go between you guys
116 00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:07,731 SPEAKER_05: and the clients and what that means is I am talking to these folks, the clients,
117 00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:11,528 SPEAKER_05: on a fairly regular basis, and regular is the key thing.
118 00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:14,532 SPEAKER_05: You know, regularly I go talk to them,
119 00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:18,498 SPEAKER_05: get a sense of, hey, what are your pin points with what you're using right now?
120 00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:19,645 SPEAKER_05: What's not working?
121 00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,737 SPEAKER_05: What is working?
122 00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,020 SPEAKER_05: What do we need to change, right?
123 00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,682 SPEAKER_05: And I translate those conversations into
124 00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:31,592 SPEAKER_05: Agile Speak, which would work for you guys.
125 00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,380 SPEAKER_05: What are the user personas?
126 00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,505 SPEAKER_05: What are the epics?
127 00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:37,397 SPEAKER_05: What are the user stories in these epics?
128 00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,642 SPEAKER_05: What are the examples criteria?
129 00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:43,843 SPEAKER_05: Can you put together a UX and a markup of what
130 00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,520 SPEAKER_05: this thing should look like.
131 00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,147 SPEAKER_05: And then we
132 00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:51,150 SPEAKER_05: work together, you guys in the room and myself,
133 00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:56,128 SPEAKER_05: and we put them back to develop what these guys want.
134 00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,839 SPEAKER_05: And then, what?
135 00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:01,866 SPEAKER_05: The word regular will keep coming up, which is really key.
136 00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:06,692 SPEAKER_05: that gap between what they think they asked for and what they got.
137 00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:11,029 SPEAKER_05: That gap should not exist and it really didn't.
138 00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,885 SPEAKER_05: It kept coming up from time to time because people, if you have a conversation on day one,
139 00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:22,875 SPEAKER_05: And on day 45, you deliver something to these clients
140 00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:26,554 SPEAKER_05: that's a lot of days that have passed between
141 00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:29,946 SPEAKER_05: what they thought they wanted and what they think they're getting.
142 00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,207 SPEAKER_05: So that gap needs to reduce.
143 00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,059 SPEAKER_05: So what I mean by that is, okay,
144 00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:40,847 SPEAKER_05: If you do sprints, is it a two-week sprint, is it a week sprint, whatever it is,
145 00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:46,669 SPEAKER_05: coming up with an iterative development process where
146 00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:52,660 SPEAKER_05: Even if you haven't completely delivered all of the bells and whistles, all the buttons in the UI,
147 00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,731 SPEAKER_05: you at least give them
148 00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:00,017 SPEAKER_05: a UI that has the
149 00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,291 SPEAKER_05: major elements in it so that they can start looking at it
150 00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,630 SPEAKER_05: after the first week, after the second week, whatever it is.
151 00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:07,324 SPEAKER_05: And I'm talking to them.
152 00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:10,800 SPEAKER_05: you know every week let's say uh and so
153 00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,053 SPEAKER_05: the best way to think of that is iterative versus incremental.
154 00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:19,457 SPEAKER_05: This is a classic, and if you Google it, you'll find it.
155 00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:24,368 SPEAKER_05: the Mona Lisa painting, there's two ways to develop the Mona Lisa painting.
156 00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:29,397 SPEAKER_05: One is the iterative process where you draw an outline of the entire
157 00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,072 SPEAKER_05: Mona Lisa in the painting.
158 00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:33,514 SPEAKER_05: And then that's the first prop
159 00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:36,518 SPEAKER_05: from this sprint, first sprint.
160 00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:40,146 SPEAKER_05: And then every subsequent sprint you start to fill it out.
161 00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:45,057 SPEAKER_05: You put more colors in paintings and color the hair.
162 00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,452 SPEAKER_05: the face and all that stuff.
163 00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,938 SPEAKER_05: But the client
164 00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:54,912 SPEAKER_05: sees that initial drop from the first sprint and they're like, okay
165 00:09:54,892 --> 00:10:00,042 SPEAKER_05: There's no gap between what they thought they wanted versus what they're starting to get.
166 00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:05,509 SPEAKER_05: And so in each subsequent sprint, you iterate through and you start building out the painting.
167 00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:09,103 SPEAKER_05: And at the end of it, they see what they've got.
168 00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,551 SPEAKER_05: Now, that's one approach.
169 00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:15,094 SPEAKER_05: The other approach is incremental where you tape the top left corner of the Mona Lisa paint
170 00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,997 SPEAKER_05: You fill out all the details of, you know,
171 00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:22,232 SPEAKER_05: her face, or maybe just the face, right, in the first sprint.
172 00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:25,708 SPEAKER_05: but none of the other parts of the painting.
173 00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:30,518 SPEAKER_05: And then you show that to the client and they're like, wait a minute, this is not what I asked for.
174 00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:32,673 SPEAKER_05: So the gap starts to develop, right?
175 00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:36,357 SPEAKER_05: So that's my long-winded way of saying, you know,
176 00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:40,592 SPEAKER_05: My role here will be to help you guys get some kind of a process
177 00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:45,874 SPEAKER_05: where we start to do an iterative process
178 00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:51,865 SPEAKER_05: delivery to these clients so that there is no gap or if there is a gap it is fairly quickly
179 00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:54,123 SPEAKER_05: fixed and blocked.
180 00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:55,493 SPEAKER_05: That's the point.
181 00:10:55,473 --> 00:11:01,433 SPEAKER_05: from the initial conversation that may seem like the pin point in the process, but I don't know.
182 00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:06,073 SPEAKER_05: That's my value add here, so I'll stop talking.
183 00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:11,912 SPEAKER_05: Any thoughts or any reactions?
184 00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:17,295 SPEAKER_07: That sounds great, honestly.
185 00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,969 SPEAKER_07: We could definitely use some more structure like that.
186 00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,286 SPEAKER_07: I think the thing that I'm curious about most
187 00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,302 SPEAKER_07: is seeing how this will fit into our team
188 00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:33,073 SPEAKER_07: I think a lot of the teams here deal with this but like I think for ours it's worse.
189 00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:36,398 SPEAKER_07: Is that we support, I guess,
190 00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:40,566 SPEAKER_07: probably like three or four main groups of users which I guess you guys know
191 00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:46,371 SPEAKER_07: about the finance side of things, but we also deal with some of the HR stuff and sales.
192 00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:50,910 SPEAKER_07: I'm just kind of curious how that's going to look with like sprints and stuff whenever we have
193 00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,268 SPEAKER_07: Lots of tiny little things to do on all these different apps and different
194 00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,795 SPEAKER_07: times versus working on one big feature or epic at a time?
195 00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,569 SPEAKER_07: I'm kind of curious, I guess.
196 00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:02,875 SPEAKER_05: Right, so I think we want to start small.
197 00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:08,207 SPEAKER_05: So what I mean by that is if right now you're saying the finance and accounting team is
198 00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,097 SPEAKER_05: that client is
199 00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:15,953 SPEAKER_05: the most hopeful, let's say, or the one that's had, that's been most...
200 00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:18,889 SPEAKER_05: make the most noise, let's start with that team, right?
201 00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:24,137 SPEAKER_05: So let's focus on what their needs are or what their
202 00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:29,908 SPEAKER_05: pin points are and focus on trying to
203 00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:34,988 SPEAKER_05: internalize our process, setting it up so that we can
204 00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:39,021 SPEAKER_05: you know, reduce this gap between what they think they ask for and
205 00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:41,427 SPEAKER_05: when they get it, what they think they ask for.
206 00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:42,902 SPEAKER_05: That gap needs to
207 00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:46,041 SPEAKER_05: come back and we need to get rid of that gap.
208 00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:51,964 SPEAKER_05: And the way we're gonna do that is, well, I'm jumping ahead, I have to dive into your process and all that stuff.
209 00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:55,192 SPEAKER_05: we need to get that gap reduced.
210 00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:56,402 SPEAKER_05: So let's start with that team.
211 00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:59,442 SPEAKER_05: And yes, you're serving more than one client.
212 00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:01,093 SPEAKER_05: I'm going to just use the word client.
213 00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,245 SPEAKER_05: you know, user groups.
214 00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:06,966 SPEAKER_05: And then once we have this working and we
215 00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:12,957 SPEAKER_05: prove this as a proof point, this process that we're putting in place, it works.
216 00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:14,047 SPEAKER_05: this client.
217 00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:17,496 SPEAKER_05: Now let's then go find the next client.
218 00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,591 SPEAKER_05: and then refine.
219 00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:23,318 SPEAKER_05: And so starting small would be the best way to do this.
220 00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:28,414 SPEAKER_05: And you'll find that we have to, each iteration, I don't know if
221 00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:32,937 SPEAKER_05: So every sprint, we have a retrospective.
222 00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:35,940 SPEAKER_05: We stop and say, hey, what worked?
223 00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,241 SPEAKER_05: what did not work, what needs to change, right?
224 00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:40,328 SPEAKER_05: And what do we,
225 00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:45,188 SPEAKER_05: There's three questions we ask, and so we ask those questions.
226 00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:50,166 SPEAKER_05: of ourselves and then go around the room and just
227 00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:55,212 SPEAKER_05: take that feedback and tweak the process and go to the next sprint.
228 00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:58,090 SPEAKER_05: And so, that is going to be useful.
229 00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,168 SPEAKER_05: And so once we have something working for one
230 00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:04,189 SPEAKER_05: client, then we go off and
231 00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:08,728 SPEAKER_05: work with the next team, next team, next team.
232 00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,923 SPEAKER_05: Just so we can roll this out.
233 00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,171 SPEAKER_05: In terms of
234 00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,226 SPEAKER_05: of the product management function.
235 00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:16,542 SPEAKER_05: I've mentioned this to Christopher as well.
236 00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,558 SPEAKER_05: I am one person and I have only so many hours with you guys.
237 00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:25,924 SPEAKER_05: We may bring in more folks, but let's first prove this as a process that it works.
238 00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:31,780 SPEAKER_05: Then we can look at rolling this out to other teams and other clients.
239 00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,279 SPEAKER_05: Does that make sense?
240 00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:34,817 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
241 00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:40,048 SPEAKER_01: And just to add to that, something that we're keeping in mind as a
242 00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:45,178 SPEAKER_01: an overall team, I say team, but department
243 00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:49,600 SPEAKER_01: I guess is better used for that.
244 00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,346 SPEAKER_01: The team structure is and has been
245 00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:57,345 SPEAKER_01: the way it has been for I don't know how many years now, four or five?
246 00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:01,446 SPEAKER_01: We're open-minded on if
247 00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:05,310 SPEAKER_01: the team structure the way it is currently
248 00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,495 SPEAKER_01: housed to where we have roughly four
249 00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,499 SPEAKER_01: I guess three or four guys on each team.
250 00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,739 SPEAKER_01: that will work on this group of applications.
251 00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:20,802 SPEAKER_01: If it makes more sense to do it a different way, whether it's
252 00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:24,058 SPEAKER_01: just blowing it all up and not have teams and just.
253 00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:29,323 SPEAKER_01: kind of give a project to a certain amount of people or developers or widdle
254 00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:34,015 SPEAKER_01: it down into smaller teams to where they're focused more on certain things.
255 00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:39,550 SPEAKER_01: We're open to anything like that, so just keep that in your mind if we're
256 00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,022 SPEAKER_01: if we get into talking about these things and you notice that
257 00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:47,363 SPEAKER_01: like the ones that are more vocal,
258 00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:53,252 SPEAKER_01: are always going to be the ones that get their applications worked on the most.
259 00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:56,652 SPEAKER_01: Well, maybe we can think about it a little bit different on the team side.
260 00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,758 SPEAKER_05: Absolutely.
261 00:15:57,738 --> 00:16:03,040 SPEAKER_05: the advantage of just doing this small approach is
262 00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:08,406 SPEAKER_05: you've got an existing, the analogy I use is,
263 00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:12,298 SPEAKER_05: You're on a cruise in the middle of the Pacific.
264 00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:13,367 SPEAKER_05: You're on a ship.
265 00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:18,987 SPEAKER_05: and you're trying to change an engine part because there's something not working with it.
266 00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:22,638 SPEAKER_05: But the ship needs to keep going.
267 00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,488 SPEAKER_05: So you cannot just stop the ship
268 00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:26,705 SPEAKER_05: replace the entire engine and then start again.
269 00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,842 SPEAKER_05: We have to keep cruising.
270 00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:35,085 SPEAKER_05: uh so you take a small part of that engine you replace it and then hopefully that
271 00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:40,587 SPEAKER_05: satisfies the people on deck that were complaining about that engine part.
272 00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:45,919 SPEAKER_05: You don't want to have to stop everything or start plugging things willy-nilly
273 00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,359 SPEAKER_05: where everybody on desktop starts complaining.
274 00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,880 SPEAKER_05: So you don't want all your client teams
275 00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,996 SPEAKER_05: getting really mad at you.
276 00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,483 SPEAKER_05: Let's just take the really small piece.
277 00:16:56,463 --> 00:16:59,824 SPEAKER_05: and replace that engine in
278 00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:02,039 SPEAKER_05: the middle of your cruise, so.
279 00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:04,617 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and that makes it easy.
280 00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:09,595 SPEAKER_05: But but yeah, thank you that you can stand back once we have
281 00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:15,585 SPEAKER_05: one or two or three clients happy with whatever process we end up with
282 00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:20,479 SPEAKER_05: then we can step back and say, is there a more efficient way to deliver
283 00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,204 SPEAKER_05: what these clients are asking for and maybe we
284 00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:30,351 SPEAKER_05: arrange the teams or broaden the process, but that's.
285 00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:33,073 SPEAKER_05: Got a zest, you know, start small.
286 00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:33,658 SPEAKER_05: That works.
287 00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:39,649 SPEAKER_01: Just going through some of the lists that you sent out in the meeting invite.
288 00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:45,353 SPEAKER_01: We are getting you an account set up and a VM to remote into to kind of look at
289 00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,842 SPEAKER_01: everything we have, so that'll be shortcoming.
290 00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:54,988 SPEAKER_01: The next one was walk through existing functionality.
291 00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:56,777 SPEAKER_01: I don't know how deep I want to get into that.
292 00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:58,345 SPEAKER_01: Go ahead.
293 00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:02,042 SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I think this may have to wait for a little bit.
294 00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:05,847 SPEAKER_05: What I'm trying to do is to get my arms around all of this stuff.
295 00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:07,780 SPEAKER_05: The people, the processes,
296 00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,758 SPEAKER_05: the technology, what you guys have built, all that stuff.
297 00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:18,748 SPEAKER_05: Once I have the login, maybe you can, once I have the setup, maybe something.
298 00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:21,752 SPEAKER_05: Ethan if you could walk me through what's, you know,
299 00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:26,306 SPEAKER_05: what they're using, the client, the accounting team?
300 00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:26,528 SPEAKER_07: Yeah.
301 00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:30,021 SPEAKER_05: And then I also want to dive into the process that
302 00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:34,003 SPEAKER_05: your team is using, you know,
303 00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:37,682 SPEAKER_05: Adam, you mentioned you guys use Jira as well.
304 00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:42,880 SPEAKER_05: if i can get an account on Jira i would look at uh
305 00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:49,157 SPEAKER_01: And then we also have it synced up to the DevOps side where these guys mainly work out of.
306 00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:55,148 SPEAKER_02: And we also have a Confluence knowledge base.
307 00:18:55,128 --> 00:19:00,092 SPEAKER_02: We have a Confluence knowledge base that's tied into that as well.
308 00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,902 SPEAKER_05: And do the clients take a look at the Confluence pages at all?
309 00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:07,420 SPEAKER_01: No, those are mostly internally for now.
310 00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,998 SPEAKER_05: Okay.
310 00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,998 SPEAKER_01: They're...
311 00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:16,090 SPEAKER_01: I don't know if we really have any KBs out there for that kind of stuff.
312 00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,359 SPEAKER_01: Yeah those are mostly just internal for us as developers.
313 00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:25,000 SPEAKER_05: Okay, so in terms of community,
314 00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:29,303 SPEAKER_05: So maybe this is diving into the process now, but
315 00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,741 SPEAKER_05: when you either you've got
316 00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:37,099 SPEAKER_05: certain set of features that economy wants now
317 00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:42,212 SPEAKER_05: Could you talk a little bit about the process that exists now
318 00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:46,347 SPEAKER_07: Yeah, currently, usually what we'll do is
319 00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:50,970 SPEAKER_07: Most of the time, the clients will reach out to me
320 00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,965 SPEAKER_07: and they'll kind of explain what they want and we'll talk through it and stuff and then I will go
321 00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,560 SPEAKER_07: either onto JIRA, we've started using that more now,
322 00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,048 SPEAKER_07: or sometimes directly into DevOps, but we'll create the work items there like user stories or
323 00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:07,170 SPEAKER_07: issues, you know, depending on what it is.
324 00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,423 SPEAKER_07: And then I'll communicate, like, so our team, the finance team,
325 00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:17,413 SPEAKER_07: We meet like every morning around I think 8:30 we kind of discuss like what we're working on currently and y'know
326 00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:20,738 SPEAKER_07: what we did the day before.
327 00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:24,754 SPEAKER_07: that's usually when we'll kind of figure out who's gonna work on what
328 00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:28,281 SPEAKER_07: we'll just put that into an iteration but we don't have like a very
329 00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:31,285 SPEAKER_07: I guess structured process.
330 00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:35,048 SPEAKER_07: We tried on our most recent project to follow something
331 00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:38,305 SPEAKER_07: more agile like where we did sprints like we did like one month sprints on it.
332 00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:42,979 SPEAKER_07: But typically we just kind of work on these as they come in and then we'll group.
333 00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:48,565 SPEAKER_07: group up a couple of issues or user stories together into one release and then push it out and
334 00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:54,555 SPEAKER_07: Usually at that point we'll communicate either over teams or phone call with the users and let them know that that's out.
335 00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:58,572 SPEAKER_05: Just diving into the actual intake itself,
336 00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:03,820 SPEAKER_05: So you, so the client folks know to contact you.
337 00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,892 SPEAKER_05: You're the point of contact for things that they want.
338 00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:07,397 SPEAKER_07: Yeah.
339 00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:09,791 SPEAKER_05: And so they just call you?
340 00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,008 SPEAKER_01: Not anymore.
340 00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,008 SPEAKER_05: Not anymore? Ok.
341 00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:16,105 SPEAKER_07: I'm trying to get away from that.
342 00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:19,193 SPEAKER_06: Which that flow is part of like
343 00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:22,821 SPEAKER_06: What we were reaching out to you for like looking at this
344 00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:25,926 SPEAKER_06: what Ethan described and that flow had been
345 00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:30,499 SPEAKER_06: I mean, detrimental might be an overstatement, but it really impacted
346 00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:33,823 SPEAKER_06: his personal workflow and his team's workflow.
347 00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:38,025 SPEAKER_06: We've been trying to move that up like what Adam had said Scott's been doing.
348 00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:43,999 SPEAKER_06: he and his team are taking or triaging those calls, but a lot of the
349 00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:49,990 SPEAKER_06: migration to that hasn't been super smooth with the with the user base because they
350 00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,238 SPEAKER_06: they have this feeling that really Ethan's the only person they can talk to and so
351 00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:59,558 SPEAKER_06: so what's ended up happening a lot of times they'll call Scott and Scott will attempt to
352 00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:03,709 SPEAKER_06: troubleshoot the problem and at the end of the day they'll just say, we need to talk to Ethan.
353 00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:07,810 SPEAKER_01: Just growing pains on knowledge.
354 00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,877 SPEAKER_06: And so we're working on trying to like, and Scott's been doing a great job on
355 00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:15,117 SPEAKER_06: gathering as much information as he can to kind of
356 00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:18,846 SPEAKER_06: I guess prime Ethan for what's coming.
357 00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:22,407 SPEAKER_06: but we haven't quite made that transition yet to where
358 00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:25,326 SPEAKER_06: Ethan's not having to feel so much of that himself.
359 00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:31,958 SPEAKER_05: And Scott, how often do you meet with these folks, with the client team, the accounting folks?
360 00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:34,200 SPEAKER_02: You mean, oh, I haven't yet.
360 00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:34,200 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean it's...
361 00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,058 SPEAKER_05: So you haven't?
362 00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:40,041 SPEAKER_01: It's basically when they're calling is when we're meeting them.
363 00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:44,260 SPEAKER_02: I don't really have a good working relationship with most of them.
364 00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,710 SPEAKER_02: I have been to some of the plants and some of the teams, but not all of them.
365 00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:51,275 SPEAKER_05: Okay.
366 00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:56,292 SPEAKER_05: The accounting folks specifically, how often do they
367 00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:59,751 SPEAKER_05: Yes, they're the ones that are most vocal right now, but
368 00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,445 SPEAKER_05: How often do they vocalize?
369 00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:03,784 SPEAKER_05: I'm trying to get a sense of, you know,
370 00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:06,275 SPEAKER_05: the actual intake process in detail.
371 00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:09,690 SPEAKER_05: How do they just call you Ethan every day? Every hour?
371 00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:09,690 SPEAKER_07: I mean...
372 00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,880 SPEAKER_03: It's like.
373 00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,841 SPEAKER_03: how often they run into a problem.
374 00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:22,161 SPEAKER_07: they don't usually put in tickets like as soon as they run into an issue usually they will
375 00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:25,165 SPEAKER_07: call directly and ask to speak to me.
376 00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:28,168 SPEAKER_07: or sometimes Sai now, but
377 00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:32,488 SPEAKER_07: Yeah, I'd say it depends, but anywhere from...
378 00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:36,673 SPEAKER_07: three to 20 times a week, it just really depends.
379 00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:41,213 SPEAKER_07: But yeah sometimes it'll be seven or eight times in a single day.
380 00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,966 SPEAKER_05: And they won't to use emails to communicate, right?
381 00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:46,478 SPEAKER_05: It's basically phone calls.
382 00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:46,941 SPEAKER_07: Yeah.
383 00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:48,511 SPEAKER_01: That's their preferred guess.
384 00:23:48,532 --> 00:23:48,833 SPEAKER_02: Yes.
385 00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:51,692 SPEAKER_02: We're trying to get
386 00:23:51,672 --> 00:23:56,012 SPEAKER_02: them to go through me right now they call one number
387 00:23:55,992 --> 00:24:01,075 SPEAKER_02: and it comes to Adam or I, and we get an issue put in,
388 00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:02,505 SPEAKER_02: if they'll explain it to us.
389 00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:06,593 SPEAKER_02: Many times it will be, I just need to talk to Ethan.
390 00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:12,027 SPEAKER_02: So I've been trying to keep notes on those types of things and
391 00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:17,157 SPEAKER_02: Generate issues when I can ahead of time to keep a history of what's going on.
392 00:24:17,508 --> 00:24:20,506 SPEAKER_06: And for minors, those calls could be anything, too.
393 00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:22,337 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, absolutely.
394 00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:25,341 SPEAKER_06: It could be like almost a network down.
395 00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:29,070 SPEAKER_06: issue that they're experiencing that really needs to be looked at now.
396 00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,604 SPEAKER_06: It could be something they're thinking of on the current most recent release.
397 00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:34,369 SPEAKER_06: It could be
398 00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:38,368 SPEAKER_06: little thing that's bugging them or it could just be a hypothetical like hey
399 00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:40,204 SPEAKER_06: what if we decide to do this, is that doable?
400 00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:41,777 SPEAKER_06: I mean, it can range.
401 00:24:41,757 --> 00:24:43,814 SPEAKER_06: of any of those things.
402 00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:44,983 SPEAKER_07: Or even sometimes like,
403 00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:49,639 SPEAKER_07: Just like, hey, can you write me like a query, like a SQL query that will find this information?
404 00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,042 SPEAKER_02: Sure.
405 00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:50,687 SPEAKER_07: Yeah.
406 00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,860 SPEAKER_08: Yeah, one time I had a call that was like,
407 00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,766 SPEAKER_08: Jordan literally just fixed it right as I answered the call, so it was great.
408 00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:03,597 SPEAKER_03: I mean that is like a
409 00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:09,115 SPEAKER_03: natural behavior to them i mean even for us if we have some credit card issue
410 00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:10,836 SPEAKER_03: that charge could
411 00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:16,911 SPEAKER_03: by some reason we just want to get to the direct person and
412 00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:21,585 SPEAKER_03: get it resolved instead of writing emails or chatting through a customer.
413 00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:24,842 SPEAKER_01: They have that avenue, that's what they want.
414 00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:27,576 SPEAKER_02: They get requests through email, Teams, Slack.
415 00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:31,592 SPEAKER_02: There are various ways this happens.
416 00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,917 SPEAKER_02: And it will bypass the initial triage intake.
417 00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:38,832 SPEAKER_06: I'll say that's been a hurdle for us like doing in-house
418 00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:43,219 SPEAKER_06: any in-house IT since as long as I've been here is that
419 00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:48,855 SPEAKER_06: Anytime I've tried to operate or do something like an IT shop would do
420 00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:52,062 SPEAKER_06: like a third party IT shop providing a service.
421 00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:57,073 SPEAKER_06: where we kind of set up the contractual guidelines and we define the flow.
422 00:25:57,053 --> 00:26:00,752 SPEAKER_06: It's been a struggle here because
423 00:26:00,732 --> 00:26:06,743 SPEAKER_06: I'm not saying we're not on the same team, we are all on the same team, but there's this tendency to believe that
424 00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:10,860 SPEAKER_06: any sort of structure or hierarchy we want to
425 00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,332 SPEAKER_06: put in is a roadblock to us really working together.
426 00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:21,475 SPEAKER_06: We all work for WW, so if the accounting team has a question, they should just be able to call and talk to
427 00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,953 SPEAKER_06: any developer they want because we're all working for the same team.
428 00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:25,696 SPEAKER_06: They're dedicated.
429 00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:27,465 SPEAKER_06: We have a team dedicated to them
430 00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:33,456 SPEAKER_06: And so as soon as we put in any structure of like, well, you need to call this number or email this ticket in,
431 00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:37,202 SPEAKER_06: It's, well, no, that's impacting my workflow.
432 00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:41,623 SPEAKER_06: So I'm not going to do that because we're all on the same team here.
433 00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:42,877 SPEAKER_06: You can see what I mean.
434 00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:43,281 SPEAKER_06: It's not.
435 00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,100 SPEAKER_06: We've had trouble operating
436 00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,559 SPEAKER_06: As a software shop and I'm not saying we should
437 00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,647 SPEAKER_06: operate everything as if we're a third party.
438 00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:54,988 SPEAKER_06: But we've hit resistance there in the past.
439 00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,887 SPEAKER_05: That is a big problem because it's not
440 00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,548 SPEAKER_05: Yes, it impacts the client's workflow.
441 00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:08,775 SPEAKER_05: On the flip side, it is affecting Ethan and all the delivery teams.
442 00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:14,142 SPEAKER_05: It's affecting your workflow if you are working on something and get interrupted, right?
443 00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,563 SPEAKER_05: It doesn't, it's not an optimal situation.
444 00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:23,659 SPEAKER_05: This is probably because we may have to take this offline to bubble this up, higher up.
445 00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:27,793 SPEAKER_05: This is a process change.
446 00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,797 SPEAKER_05: that will need to get signed off from
447 00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:34,662 SPEAKER_06: And that's what I would hope that at the end of the day I feel like if we
448 00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:39,066 SPEAKER_06: If we do like what you described well and we build out this product
449 00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:43,943 SPEAKER_06: product management system well
449 00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:43,943 SPEAKER_05: yeah
449 00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:43,943 SPEAKER_06: i think that a lot of the other
450 00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:46,947 SPEAKER_06: Because, I mean, they're not hard enough.
451 00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:47,510 SPEAKER_06: to work with.
452 00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,773 SPEAKER_06: I mean they easily acknowledge that they want to be respectful of these guys time just as
453 00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,333 SPEAKER_06: So they're not, they're not
454 00:27:55,313 --> 00:28:01,324 SPEAKER_06: problematic in that sense, but I think that that gap in expectations you were talking about
455 00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:07,315 SPEAKER_06: I feel like if we can close that and really do product management well and customer service well, I think that it will
456 00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:09,650 SPEAKER_06: it will alleviate a lot of the other issues.
457 00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,905 SPEAKER_06: And like you said, the regular communication,
458 00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:17,170 SPEAKER_06: if they're being regularly heard and their needs are being addressed and questions being answered,
459 00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:23,160 SPEAKER_06: I think that a lot of the other stuff will slowly make itself not an issue anymore
460 00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,287 SPEAKER_06:
461 00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:24,425 SPEAKER_05: Absolutely.
462 00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:29,792 SPEAKER_05: So this, Scott, you're driving the triage team, right?
463 00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:30,000 SPEAKER_05: You're, you're...
464 00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:36,205 SPEAKER_05: That is a really good idea because you want to separate out the
465 00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:42,195 SPEAKER_05: Network down versus, you know, network is up and running, but this button is not doing what it's supposed to do.
466 00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:45,537 SPEAKER_05: versus I want a new button.
466 00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:45,537 SPEAKER_02: Right.
467 00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,034 SPEAKER_05: You can split them up into three categories of
468 00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:53,333 SPEAKER_05: burning building something that currently you know the plumbing is broken fix it right now
469 00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:57,940 SPEAKER_05: Versus, you know, so that is an absolutely
470 00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,525 SPEAKER_05: critical part of the intake when we need them to buy into that process.
471 00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:07,862 SPEAKER_05: It's great that you guys are already thinking about that and put that in place.
472 00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,258 SPEAKER_05: So that process needs to
473 00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:16,114 SPEAKER_05: be adhered to, it needs to not jump into, hey, get Ethan on the phone.
474 00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:17,779 SPEAKER_05: Ethan is not available anymore.
475 00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,118 SPEAKER_05: He's left the building.
476 00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:22,729 SPEAKER_02: That's going to be difficult, but we'll get there, I think.
477 00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:23,738 SPEAKER_05: I'm joking.
478 00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,965 SPEAKER_05: I'm just...
478 00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,965 SPEAKER_02: Obviously.
479 00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:30,407 SPEAKER_05: That intake process is really key.
480 00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:35,301 SPEAKER_05: you need to free up Ethan and their team to have a more
481 00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,228 SPEAKER_05: rational list of, hey, here's all this stuff, we triaged it,
482 00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,317 SPEAKER_05: this sprint, you're gonna do this work
482 00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,317 SPEAKER_02: Right, right.
483 00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:47,130 SPEAKER_03: Well, if Ethan left the building, is Sai available?
484 00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,139 SPEAKER_02: Right?
485 00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:52,193 SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's a lot of that.
486 00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:57,255 SPEAKER_06: And that's why I like having triage and product management
487 00:29:57,235 --> 00:30:01,963 SPEAKER_06: as these buffers between, like you said, with intake between the rest of the company,
488 00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:05,608 SPEAKER_06: all the clients and the engineers and the dev team.
489 00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:11,548 SPEAKER_06: I think if we implement that and they're satisfied with what the deliverables are, I don't think it will be a
490 00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:14,839 SPEAKER_06: I think it will move away from like as Ethan said
491 00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:17,927 SPEAKER_06: here, oh no Ethan, what about Sai, what about Jacob, I think that
492 00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:21,522 SPEAKER_06: if they know that when they come into triage or product development,
493 00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:27,310 SPEAKER_06: they know they're cared for, and they're going to get what they need, and I think it will take care of itself.
494 00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,180 SPEAKER_06: And maybe I'm too idealistic.
495 00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,659 SPEAKER_03: I would like to give a small input on this topic.
496 00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:36,827 SPEAKER_03: for what I have worked for seven good months.
497 00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:40,793 SPEAKER_03: I feel like what we are lacking is one service team.
498 00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:45,079 SPEAKER_03: because we have a development team but their queries can be entered
499 00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,821 SPEAKER_03: if they can be addressed by a dedicated service team,
500 00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:55,170 SPEAKER_03: to answer those service calls, that would help our workflow a lot.
501 00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,165 SPEAKER_02: That's going to take some of that building that confluence knowledge base out.
502 00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:04,992 SPEAKER_02: so that we can handle some more of those issues instead of
503 00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,835 SPEAKER_02: So I know there are things that come in that just need a script run.
503 00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,835 SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
504 00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:15,285 SPEAKER_02: If that can be taken care of in triage, that's going to help a lot.
505 00:31:15,535 --> 00:31:20,095 SPEAKER_02: And we've got priorities in there that we're starting to implement now as well, but I don't feel like
506 00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:23,115 SPEAKER_02: the users really get it.
507 00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:27,756 SPEAKER_02: They just feel like, okay, if I put everything in as high priority, it'll just get done fast.
507 00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:27,756 SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
508 00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:33,595 SPEAKER_06: so does that give you enough of a snapshot Krishna, the workflow?
508 00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:33,595 SPEAKER_05: This is good.
509 00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,211 SPEAKER_05: This is good.
510 00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:37,999 SPEAKER_05: I think what I would want to do is to
511 00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,070 SPEAKER_05: you know, dive into the triage process as it's own stuff.
512 00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,137 SPEAKER_05: And then with Ethan on the back end side,
513 00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:51,718 SPEAKER_05: More detail about the app, you know, JIRA and all of that stuff, the systems and
514 00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:57,642 SPEAKER_05: But I am getting a good flavor of where the issues with problems are
515 00:31:57,622 --> 00:32:01,050 SPEAKER_05: Making sure the issues aren't overloaded.
516 00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,730 SPEAKER_05: But yeah, but yeah, this is good.
517 00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,611 SPEAKER_05: I think this is a good discussion.
518 00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:10,602 SPEAKER_05: It's not just important for us in the delivery side to have a process.
519 00:32:10,582 --> 00:32:13,791 SPEAKER_05: It's very important for the clients to follow
520 00:32:14,817 --> 00:32:16,307 SPEAKER_05: It's communication, right?
521 00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,832 SPEAKER_05: Right now, it's a small company,
522 00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,681 SPEAKER_05: But it's not.
523 00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:23,410 SPEAKER_05: It's a fairly big team here, right?
524 00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:29,400 SPEAKER_05: and it's no longer the case that you can just pick up the phone, call Ethan and say, hey, this thing is broke.
525 00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,433 SPEAKER_05: We have to have some
526 00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:37,433 SPEAKER_05: rational processes that everybody follows and obeys.
527 00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:42,985 SPEAKER_05: Maybe if the Confluence, and I'm just throwing this out, before I, in accounting,
528 00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:48,486 SPEAKER_05: feel like calling Ethan, maybe I take a look at this Confluence page and do a little
529 00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,895 SPEAKER_05: diagnostic myself and say, hey, I'm seeing
530 00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:56,907 SPEAKER_05: This error message, let me check if there's something on the Confluence page that talks about that.
531 00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,637 SPEAKER_05: And so maybe I can help, self help this.
532 00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:01,918 SPEAKER_05: Maybe I can fix my own problem.
533 00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:07,335 SPEAKER_05: Instead of having Ethan, instead of having to call Ethan and say, hey,
534 00:33:07,315 --> 00:33:09,087 SPEAKER_05: and see if there's any points up ahead.
535 00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:11,563 SPEAKER_05: This has already been documented by Knowledge Base systems.
536 00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:13,073 SPEAKER_05: Go take a look at that.
537 00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:18,304 SPEAKER_05: So maybe that kind of a self-help process would be the first point.
538 00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:23,738 SPEAKER_05: for those classes of problems where network is down or
539 00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,156 SPEAKER_05: Uh...
540 00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,373 SPEAKER_05: the plumbing is broke.
541 00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,129 SPEAKER_05: If it's an enhancement request, maybe,
542 00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,913 SPEAKER_05: I in the accounting team just go to
543 00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:39,062 SPEAKER_05: JIRA, and I submit an enhancement request.
544 00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:41,052 SPEAKER_05: Maybe the form could be made fairly simple enough for me to
545 00:33:41,538 --> 00:33:42,335 SPEAKER_05: Understand.
546 00:33:42,922 --> 00:33:48,645 SPEAKER_05: And so that work, that intake process, I'm sort of offloading it.
547 00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:53,320 SPEAKER_05: what I, Krishna, is suggesting is sharing that responsibility with the client teams and
548 00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,078 SPEAKER_05: giving them enough tools to A diagnose themselves,
549 00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,453 SPEAKER_05: B submit requests themselves.
550 00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:04,778 SPEAKER_05: If that doesn't work, then maybe
551 00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:07,782 SPEAKER_05: Scott and the triage team might get on the phone with him.
552 00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,612 SPEAKER_05: But never call Ethan.
553 00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:10,858 SPEAKER_05: Don't bug Ethan.
554 00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:11,783 SPEAKER_05: He's in a sprint.
555 00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:13,452 SPEAKER_05: That's a lot.
556 00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:18,463 SPEAKER_05: You know, once the sprint starts lockdown, they might let us be even no longer available.
557 00:34:18,443 --> 00:34:23,745 SPEAKER_05: Because the work has been identified for that sprint, and that is all they're going to do.
558 00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:27,728 SPEAKER_05: maybe there's a very urgent request that maybe
559 00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,576 SPEAKER_05: changes the sprint backlog.
560 00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:33,313 SPEAKER_05: But no, once the sprint backlog has been defined,
561 00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,165 SPEAKER_05: No more, no more, no more.
562 00:34:37,185 --> 00:34:38,072 SPEAKER_01: You guys aren't here anymore.
563 00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:40,765 SPEAKER_07: Just told him that I got fired.
564 00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:43,658 SPEAKER_01: Just told him, yeah, we don't have a finance team anymore.
565 00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:47,507 SPEAKER_07: We'll all go by aliases.
566 00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:48,535 SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
567 00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:54,171 SPEAKER_05: But you know, those are some ideas we need to explore
568 00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:58,947 SPEAKER_05: Can we give these client teams some tools that A,
569 00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:01,444 SPEAKER_05: have lets them help themselves.
570 00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:05,798 SPEAKER_05: and B for burning situations, right?
571 00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:10,860 SPEAKER_05: And then B, if they want something in the future, like an enhancement request,
572 00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:15,771 SPEAKER_05: They submit it themselves and it goes to Scott and he looks at it and says,
573 00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,559 SPEAKER_05: you know, yeah, this is a valid and that's my request.
574 00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:25,305 SPEAKER_05: And it engages with the submitter to say, what do you mean?
575 00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:27,380 SPEAKER_05: by what you said, maybe.
576 00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,026 SPEAKER_05: And so we flesh that out as a user story,
577 00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:36,443 SPEAKER_05: build a mock-up based on whatever they're looking for and then we say yep
578 00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:41,455 SPEAKER_05: You know, there's this set of 10 announcement requests that have come in.
579 00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:44,560 SPEAKER_05: Now we've got to prioritize them for the next sprint.
580 00:35:44,928 --> 00:35:47,952 SPEAKER_05: So that's the kind of work me and you Scott.
581 00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:51,985 SPEAKER_05: and looking at us both as the product management team, the product team,
582 00:35:51,965 --> 00:35:54,780 SPEAKER_05: who are going to be interfacing with the client teams.
583 00:35:55,243 --> 00:35:57,756 SPEAKER_05: Ethan no longer talks to the client teams.
584 00:35:57,736 --> 00:35:59,207 SPEAKER_05: being a little extreme here.
585 00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,384 SPEAKER_05: But, you know, the point is once you
586 00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:04,388 SPEAKER_05: lockdown, Ethan and the team don't get interrupted.
586 00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:04,388 SPEAKER_02: Right.
587 00:36:04,368 --> 00:36:08,202 SPEAKER_05: Once the sprint is over, there's a small window where, yes,
588 00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:12,741 SPEAKER_05: Ethan takes a phone call or two but really we need to get away from that mindset of
589 00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:16,290 SPEAKER_05: get on the phone with Ethan and team, that's not going to work, right?
590 00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,500 SPEAKER_05: That's not going to scale.
591 00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:22,917 SPEAKER_05: And so maybe get on the phone with Scott.
592 00:36:23,453 --> 00:36:26,595 SPEAKER_05: but it all just have the,
593 00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:31,489 SPEAKER_05: getting on the phone should only be sort of last resort but
594 00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:37,159 SPEAKER_05: network is down or something is just completely not working then yeah you call Scott because
595 00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:40,365 SPEAKER_05: I cannot email or I cannot, you know,
596 00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:43,369 SPEAKER_05: I send this live, Team messages or whatever it is.
597 00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:47,114 SPEAKER_05: But, you know, and there is a regular occurence.
598 00:36:47,134 --> 00:36:49,107 SPEAKER_05: Scott meets with the client
599 00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:54,321 SPEAKER_05: We have folks every week, however often he doesn't, right?
600 00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:58,084 SPEAKER_05: And that's when they tell them, here's all the list of stuff that
601 00:36:58,705 --> 00:36:59,772 SPEAKER_05: Is not working.
602 00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:02,068 SPEAKER_05: I want new stuff, whatever it is.
603 00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:04,665 SPEAKER_05: And every week we
604 00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:07,872 SPEAKER_05: look at the stuff that they've given us from the past week,
605 00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:11,061 SPEAKER_05: We organize it, categorize it.
606 00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:16,613 SPEAKER_05: We feed into the sprint backlog, and then we communicate back to the client team and say,
607 00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:19,066 SPEAKER_05: This is what we heard from you guys.
608 00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:21,102 SPEAKER_05: This is our plan to address it.
609 00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:26,839 SPEAKER_05: you know, look for this thing to come out in the next two weeks, three weeks, whatever it is, right?
610 00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:29,893 SPEAKER_05: So that is the intake process.
611 00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:35,125 SPEAKER_05: to address the vocal clients who are
612 00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:39,968 SPEAKER_05: dissatisfied, but it will require change from both the
613 00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:44,794 SPEAKER_05: client site as well as for our site.
614 00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:50,515 SPEAKER_05: But yeah, again just getting on the phone with Ethan or something is not working, his team and Sai, or whohever else is on the team.
615 00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:56,100 SPEAKER_05: Is that's the thing that we need to break.
616 00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:59,998 SPEAKER_05: Triage team is absolutely a step in the right direction.
617 00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:04,838 SPEAKER_05: But yeah, this is good.
618 00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:06,613 SPEAKER_05: I'm getting a sense of it.
619 00:38:09,277 --> 00:38:12,790 SPEAKER_05: This is supposed to be, in my mind, this is supposed to be an introductory call.
620 00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:16,249 SPEAKER_01: You're getting a good intro.
621 00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:20,232 SPEAKER_02: We're actually planning a little bit.
622 00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:23,826 SPEAKER_05: So what I want to do is
623 00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:29,563 SPEAKER_05: Adam, you'll be setting me up with the accounts or someone will be setting me up with the accounts and stuff like that.
624 00:38:29,543 --> 00:38:31,150 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, they're working on that today.
625 00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,706 SPEAKER_05: Okay, great.
626 00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,718 SPEAKER_05: So then I can look forward to, you know, I'll set up
627 00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:41,123 SPEAKER_05: one-on-one calls, Adam, Ethan, and Scott, Sai, whoever it is
628 00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:45,780 SPEAKER_05: that you want to pull in, but I want to start the intake process
629 00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,909 SPEAKER_05: How is that working?
630 00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:48,381 SPEAKER_05: The triage process.
631 00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,893 SPEAKER_05: I want to go to Jira.
632 00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,062 SPEAKER_05: I want to understand the development
633 00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:52,069 SPEAKER_05: process itself.
634 00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:56,378 SPEAKER_05: I want to look at the actual requirements, how they've been captured,
635 00:38:56,982 --> 00:39:02,082 SPEAKER_05: You know, sometimes I can say I want a button or I want
636 00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:09,051 SPEAKER_05: Something X but in the way it's been translated into requirements made
637 00:39:09,031 --> 00:39:14,670 SPEAKER_05: lead Ethan and the team to build Y and X is not Y and so I want to just
638 00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,543 SPEAKER_05: Connect the dots from...
639 00:39:17,671 --> 00:39:23,580 SPEAKER_05: the words of the client teams to what Ethan receives and builds himself
640 00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:29,200 SPEAKER_05: And that again contributes to gap in developing.
641 00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,456 SPEAKER_05: Missions is a good thing.
642 00:39:31,698 --> 00:39:34,296 SPEAKER_01: What kind of gives you an idea of that with
643 00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:38,920 SPEAKER_01: Some of our most recent ones, or most recent projects, kind of like that.
644 00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,957 SPEAKER_01: The Check Smith one, I think is a good one to show.
645 00:39:41,937 --> 00:39:45,771 SPEAKER_01: of how the process works and what we've gathered from them.
646 00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:50,715 SPEAKER_01: and we'll see if it all makes sense to you.
647 00:39:51,202 --> 00:39:55,542 SPEAKER_05: Great. I'd like to first just start off with, you know, that list Adam you mentioned
648 00:39:55,522 --> 00:39:59,406 SPEAKER_05: who was in the meeting, who was in the team, what did you all...
649 00:39:59,386 --> 00:40:04,097 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we can do that.
650 00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:09,126 SPEAKER_05: And so then I will also be documenting as we go along
651 00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,147 SPEAKER_05: what I'm hearing from you, each of you.
652 00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:15,555 SPEAKER_05: various parts, the triage process, the intake process,
653 00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,504 SPEAKER_05: all of that stuff, I'll be putting that stuff in the slides,
654 00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:21,472 SPEAKER_05: or Word Doc, or whatever it is.
655 00:40:21,492 --> 00:40:24,313 SPEAKER_05: And then, you know,
656 00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:30,405 SPEAKER_05: I imagine this week will be spent on meeting with each of you
657 00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:36,109 SPEAKER_05: separately just to get a sense of deep diving in each area.
658 00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:39,687 SPEAKER_05: And then I'll document all of the weaknesses, give me some type of circle back.
659 00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:43,669 SPEAKER_05: So I came back and said, and say here's all the problems we have.
660 00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,300 SPEAKER_05: and here's some possible solutions.
661 00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:48,259 SPEAKER_05: It's great that you guys have already
662 00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,157 SPEAKER_05: gotten down this path of triage so now we need to figure out why it is that that's not
663 00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,063 SPEAKER_05: taking so
663 00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,063 SPEAKER_01: and that's that's in an instant stage at this point too where.
664 00:40:58,043 --> 00:41:02,856 SPEAKER_01: When we started beginning of the year, close to it.
665 00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,489 SPEAKER_01: In the spring, maybe?
666 00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:07,834 SPEAKER_02: Well, this role itself is really two years old.
667 00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:10,585 SPEAKER_02: as of right now
667 00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:10,585 SPEAKER_01: Okay.
668 00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:15,664 SPEAKER_02: Really just started working on the standard operating procedures, the protocol
669 00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:20,399 SPEAKER_02: itself over the last couple of months
669 00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:20,399 SPEAKER_01: Right.
670 00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:21,064 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
671 00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:23,523 SPEAKER_01: The idea has been there.
672 00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:28,033 SPEAKER_01: Just getting it formalized and
673 00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:33,501 SPEAKER_01: Having it put in place to where everybody knows it, that's where we're at right now.
674 00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:36,885 SPEAKER_05: Awesome.
675 00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,171 SPEAKER_05: And then also
676 00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:44,368 SPEAKER_05: Some point of this week I want to dive into the actual
677 00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:48,722 SPEAKER_05: Adam, you heard talking about the tech stack and all that, the actual,
678 00:41:49,462 --> 00:41:53,278 SPEAKER_05: frameworks and, you know, tools and how, you know,
679 00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:55,147 SPEAKER_05: databases and all that stuff.
680 00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:58,375 SPEAKER_05: I want to just get a full understanding of that as well, but that's not
681 00:41:58,355 --> 00:42:01,868 SPEAKER_05: The main priority, that's sort of what wer're working out.
682 00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:04,618 SPEAKER_05: The list I think my key things are just.
683 00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:11,166 SPEAKER_05: Now that I've met you all, the next step for me really is to
684 00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:16,819 SPEAKER_05: get the account set up, log in and then have Ethan walk me through what is
685 00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:21,510 SPEAKER_05: what they're using, the accounting folks and the modules.
686 00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:24,261 SPEAKER_05: with features and all of that.
687 00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,898 SPEAKER_05: And then
688 00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,442 SPEAKER_05: Scott, meeting with you to understand the
689 00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:34,420 SPEAKER_05: triage process, how that works.
690 00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:38,875 SPEAKER_05: I want to do this all and what I have a good understanding of our internal
691 00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:45,169 SPEAKER_05: People process technology stuff before I start engaging with the client itself.
692 00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:49,641 SPEAKER_05: When I engage with the client, I want to sort of, beyond just introductions,
693 00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,657 SPEAKER_05: Maybe the initial call is just an introduction, but I want to also sort of
694 00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:59,766 SPEAKER_05: you know, have some slides and talks about, hey, this is the new road we're going to for intake,
695 00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:03,175 SPEAKER_05: No longer do you just call Ethan and team.
696 00:43:03,155 --> 00:43:07,798 SPEAKER_05: I'm being a little harsh, but this is what the intake process is going to look like.
697 00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:13,131 SPEAKER_05: you know, maybe some forms for you to fill out when you have an idea of
698 00:43:13,111 --> 00:43:18,615 SPEAKER_05: the new thing that you want, or maybe this is where you go to see if the system is down,
699 00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:21,771 SPEAKER_05: or those kinds of classes of
700 00:43:22,274 --> 00:43:26,952 SPEAKER_05: Issue the things that they can, tools that we can give them to help themselves.
701 00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:30,985 SPEAKER_05: and then if nothing works, then yes, contact Scott.
702 00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:34,377 SPEAKER_05: or call this number, whatever it is.
703 00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:40,502 SPEAKER_05: And so that's, I wanna reach that point before we engage with the clients
704 00:43:40,482 --> 00:43:45,784 SPEAKER_05: And then separately I want to talk to them as well to get their side of
705 00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:49,363 SPEAKER_05: Why is it that, what is it that is not working for them?
706 00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,775 SPEAKER_05: And then,
707 00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:57,090 SPEAKER_05: Because now right now I'm hearing your side of what's not working.
708 00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:01,613 SPEAKER_05: I want to hear their side of what's not working and then come across there.
709 00:44:01,593 --> 00:44:06,135 SPEAKER_05: And then we can come up with a proposal for how things should change.
710 00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:09,932 SPEAKER_05: and then we'll start living that change, as they say.
711 00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,536 SPEAKER_05: But that's a little bit a ways away right now.
712 00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,636 SPEAKER_01: So what's your idea on...
713 00:44:15,616 --> 00:44:20,817 SPEAKER_01: Like as far as your time goes, I don't know what your availability is, but
714 00:44:20,797 --> 00:44:26,082 SPEAKER_01: Like once we get you set up with access and everything, we can kind of walk you through that.
715 00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:30,618 SPEAKER_01: Should we just create some calls for you to discuss?
716 00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:30,840 SPEAKER_05: Yes.
717 00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,844 SPEAKER_05: For me, once I have the account set up,
718 00:44:33,824 --> 00:44:36,489 SPEAKER_05: and I can log in and take a look at stuff.
719 00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,468 SPEAKER_05: I want to meet with Ethan
720 00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:43,564 SPEAKER_05: have him walk me through, hey, this is what the accounting folks are using right now.
721 00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:48,053 SPEAKER_05: Then I don't know who can walk me through the Jira.
722 00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:51,531 SPEAKER_05: What are the issues that are more specific, more specifically,
723 00:44:51,551 --> 00:44:53,622 SPEAKER_05: I want to understand that.
724 00:44:53,602 --> 00:44:56,811 SPEAKER_05: Right now, I am...
725 00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:02,177 SPEAKER_05: scheduled to spend four hours a day with you guys, you know,
726 00:45:02,427 --> 00:45:07,273 SPEAKER_05: I have some flexibility in terms of when that is, so I can work based on
727 00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:13,129 SPEAKER_05: what your calendar looks like in terms of eating with each of the folks.
728 00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:18,647 SPEAKER_05: And so...
728 00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:18,647 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we'll get a feeling about that whenever we start.
729 00:45:18,627 --> 00:45:19,837 SPEAKER_01: getting into talking.
730 00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:22,782 SPEAKER_01: Are you in Central Time where you're at?
731 00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,623 SPEAKER_05: I'm Mountain Time.
732 00:45:24,643 --> 00:45:26,038 SPEAKER_01: Mountain Time.
733 00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:29,768 SPEAKER_05: You know, 8 o'clock, your time, some time,
734 00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:33,328 SPEAKER_05: works for me, we can work something out.
735 00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:37,513 SPEAKER_05: If we have a calendar that you all share,
736 00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:43,167 SPEAKER_05: that I can also block off times where I have to use and maybe stop.
737 00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:47,757 SPEAKER_05: work on that, like instead of my working hours and that kind of stuff so.
738 00:45:47,737 --> 00:45:48,681 SPEAKER_01: Okay.
739 00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:53,663 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I know Ethan's got his daily meeting at 8:30 our time.
739 00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:53,663 SPEAKER_05: Okay.
740 00:45:53,643 --> 00:45:59,046 SPEAKER_01: And then we've got weekly meetings with the team leads at
741 00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:03,197 SPEAKER_01: 9 o'clock on Mondays and 9 o'clock on Thursdays in the morning.
742 00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:08,682 SPEAKER_01: But yeah, other than that, we can pretty much work around anything.
743 00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:12,681 SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I tend to work the mornings
744 00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,200 SPEAKER_05: And in the afternoon I go do my other stuff.
745 00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,729 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's fine with us.
746 00:46:18,749 --> 00:46:19,212 SPEAKER_05: Yeah, perfect.
747 00:46:19,546 --> 00:46:22,036 SPEAKER_01: Cool.

750 00:46:28,726 --> 00:46:33,321 SPEAKER_05: I don't know if you're gonna set me up with an internal email address.
751 00:46:33,342 --> 00:46:34,450 SPEAKER_01: I believe they are, yeah.
752 00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:39,327 SPEAKER_05: okay yeah

755 00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:46,364 SPEAKER_05: Mac Book

759 00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:52,573 SPEAKER_01: Not many, but...
760 00:46:52,553 --> 00:46:55,577 SPEAKER_01: They do need to just remote.
761 00:46:55,557 --> 00:47:00,235 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we'll set you up with a VM to where you can remote in and do all your work from in there.
762 00:47:00,215 --> 00:47:01,770 SPEAKER_05: Good, that's good.
763 00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:02,158 SPEAKER_05: Okay, awesome.

767 00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:13,563 SPEAKER_01: That'll work?
768 00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:17,127 SPEAKER_01: And I'll get you a list of who's who.
769 00:47:17,107 --> 00:47:21,448 SPEAKER_01: I don't know if I have a picture next to him.
770 00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:22,594 SPEAKER_01: I'll get you who's who.

793 00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,714 SPEAKER_06: I think if he can help.
794 00:48:04,694 --> 00:48:09,760 SPEAKER_06: help us build that middle layer out, like to actually be that
795 00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,776 SPEAKER_06: customer service, product management, product analysis, triage,
796 00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:17,235 SPEAKER_06: and actually like be at the end of the day be
797 00:48:17,215 --> 00:48:19,110 SPEAKER_06: serving like the end user's well.
798 00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,863 SPEAKER_06: Not that we're not now, but like I said,
799 00:48:20,843 --> 00:48:24,424 SPEAKER_06: It is a big, it does create those gaps whenever
800 00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:27,546 SPEAKER_06: we do an initial and then we're not really
801 00:48:27,526 --> 00:48:30,180 SPEAKER_06: in that customer service realm anymore.
802 00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:33,537 SPEAKER_06: You guys are just trying to code and develop and get it out the door.
803 00:48:33,517 --> 00:48:39,055 SPEAKER_06: And then you're having to wear all the hats when you do get out the door.
804 00:48:39,035 --> 00:48:44,100 SPEAKER_06: with like what's a bug, what's a new feature, what's something we need to roll up.
805 00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,792 SPEAKER_06: into another iteration what's a brand new thing they want and then meanwhile you're trying to
806 00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:52,369 SPEAKER_06: code it all to figure out I think that
807 00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,022 SPEAKER_06: and just answer questions.
808 00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:56,622 SPEAKER_01: Like I said, in the past,
809 00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,625 SPEAKER_01: It's kind of like we had to be in the beginning.
810 00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:04,587 SPEAKER_01: just because there was only so many people here to do it
810 00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:04,587 SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
810 00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:04,587 SPEAKER_01: and now that we're big enough
811 00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,877 SPEAKER_01: and we can still grow some more.
812 00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:11,522 SPEAKER_04: It sounds like his initial plan is to kind of be
813 00:49:11,502 --> 00:49:16,028 SPEAKER_04: go between and then once he kind of gets a feel for what needs to happen then he can
814 00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:19,048 SPEAKER_04: start developing the triage system.
815 00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:23,723 SPEAKER_02: Yeah,
815 00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:23,723 SPEAKER_01: I'd be a mix of...
815 00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:23,723 SPEAKER_06: I feel like, which I think he'll weigh in on
816 00:49:23,703 --> 00:49:28,110 SPEAKER_06: I feel like what you're doing on the triage is exactly what we need.
817 00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:33,055 SPEAKER_06: I just think it needs to be, you guys keep developing and then we need to sell that to the users
818 00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:39,045 SPEAKER_06: But like, I mean, I would envision everything intake wise, like he was everything coming into triage in a triage
819 00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:43,163 SPEAKER_06: you're determining where it needs to be flow out from there like it
820 00:49:43,143 --> 00:49:46,352 SPEAKER_06: maybe we end up having a support team at some point that's just
821 00:49:46,332 --> 00:49:51,111 SPEAKER_06: you just hand off to a support team that actually can answer questions, guide people through stuff.
822 00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:56,443 SPEAKER_06: to get them through using confluence on their own, you might have a,
823 00:49:56,423 --> 00:49:57,952 SPEAKER_06: something rounded to testing.
824 00:49:58,153 --> 00:50:02,316 SPEAKER_06: Like if it seems like it's an actual bug, maybe you need to triage something.
825 00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:06,653 SPEAKER_06: and then you would also have the product management that's really
826 00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:09,394 SPEAKER_06: the ultimate like user interaction.
827 00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:11,732 SPEAKER_02: I've been doing a lot of that myself.
828 00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:16,643 SPEAKER_02: in the triaging part of this testing and reproducing things that
829 00:50:16,623 --> 00:50:20,963 SPEAKER_02: that they report and that seems to work pretty well.
829 00:50:16,623 --> 00:50:20,963 SPEAKER_06: Like I would say that...
830 00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:25,637 SPEAKER_02: Coming from testing, it's been pretty easy for me to do.
831 00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:28,742 SPEAKER_06: I would say that like every development piece we do,
832 00:50:28,722 --> 00:50:32,927 SPEAKER_06: even if it's a bug like you find going back through like that.
833 00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:38,445 SPEAKER_06: Product management piece and like the product manager or whatever we call it like analysis, whatever and
834 00:50:38,425 --> 00:50:43,643 SPEAKER_06: always that user go between they're the ones that like helping build out what the iterations are what releases
835 00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,731 SPEAKER_06: are, they're the ones doing the user communication.
836 00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:49,954 SPEAKER_06: and here's what we're delivering, here's what it's gonna be, what do you need.
837 00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:53,987 SPEAKER_06: And like even if you find a bug, kind of route back through them and say, hey,
838 00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:57,717 SPEAKER_06: Changing this is this what you're saying, but let them be that go between and
839 00:50:57,697 --> 00:51:02,104 SPEAKER_06: and kill off all the communication that comes directly to not just you but like
840 00:51:02,084 --> 00:51:06,019 SPEAKER_06: your team, Conrad's team, Andrew's team, it just, like, it all stops.
841 00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:12,010 SPEAKER_06: It all goes through that flow,
841 00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:12,010 SPEAKER_00: because right now we just assign it to the team leads if there's a bug, we can just assign it to him.
842 00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:16,785 SPEAKER_03: And also, weirdly we have this situation like,
843 00:51:16,765 --> 00:51:21,105 SPEAKER_03: During development phase, we have big gap between user and
844 00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:24,480 SPEAKER_03: us developers when there is an issue.
845 00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:29,155 SPEAKER_03: there's no gap at the immediate quality.
846 00:51:29,135 --> 00:51:35,145 SPEAKER_03: There has to be a gap and there has to be a removal of the gap as well.
847 00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:41,102 SPEAKER_02: I'm really interested to see what he thinks about the documents that have gotten so far.
848 00:51:41,082 --> 00:51:42,953 SPEAKER_02: and what his suggestions would be.
849 00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:46,755 SPEAKER_02: So all that stuff is even
850 00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:48,410 SPEAKER_02: flowcharted out in there.
851 00:51:48,612 --> 00:51:50,367 SPEAKER_06: Yeah, but I think he's
852 00:51:50,347 --> 00:51:54,484 SPEAKER_06: He reckoned I mean he alluded to it in the call like he's just one person that he can't
853 00:51:54,464 --> 00:51:58,500 SPEAKER_06: do that for everyone, but like getting it off the ground here.
854 00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,504 SPEAKER_06: would be good and that's the one thing I'd like to see
855 00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:05,048 SPEAKER_06: across the board like a big picture wise if we're looking at this intake
856 00:52:05,028 --> 00:52:08,676 SPEAKER_06: flow that we talked about and there being a product management team we have to
857 00:52:08,656 --> 00:52:12,928 SPEAKER_06: build that team and that that might mean people from other teams that like.
858 00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:14,744 SPEAKER_06: really feel like they're aligned with that.
859 00:52:14,784 --> 00:52:16,115 SPEAKER_06: They would love to talk to users.
860 00:52:16,135 --> 00:52:17,164 SPEAKER_06: They would love to be that
861 00:52:17,144 --> 00:52:20,353 SPEAKER_06: Analyst go between that might mean that we build a team
862 00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:26,142 SPEAKER_06: out of our other teams, out of people that really, because I want people doing like what they love to do,
863 00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:28,683 SPEAKER_06: what they're good at doing, get people set up to win.
864 00:52:29,248 --> 00:52:31,204 SPEAKER_06: And like if there's people on our other teams
865 00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:34,410 SPEAKER_06: like to develop but they feel like this might be an itch then let's
866 00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,887 SPEAKER_06: let them come in and train and build that out, then we can
867 00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:40,907 SPEAKER_06: Again, I'd like to see a pipeline coming up of like
868 00:52:40,887 --> 00:52:42,595 SPEAKER_06: That's what I really like to have.
869 00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:44,926 SPEAKER_06: Developers are always kind of like you're doing.
870 00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,594 SPEAKER_06: Developers are coming up.
871 00:52:46,574 --> 00:52:51,184 SPEAKER_06: taking on roles that like fit them well and as we have other spots that fit
872 00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:55,943 SPEAKER_06: and get them in a place where they can really do well and succeed and help everyone.
873 00:52:55,923 --> 00:53:01,613 SPEAKER_06: so it might be that we have to kind of piece together the analysis team
874 00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:05,593 SPEAKER_06: from people who would want to do it, would love to do it and do it well.
875 00:53:05,754 --> 00:53:07,603 SPEAKER_06: And then we start bringing up more developers
876 00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:09,659 SPEAKER_06: to fill those gaps.
877 00:53:10,284 --> 00:53:12,683 SPEAKER_06: I don't ever want to get to a spot to where we're like,
878 00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:17,712 SPEAKER_06: Say like I mean you coming in and working development wise I know you were fantastic in testing and
879 00:53:17,692 --> 00:53:22,133 SPEAKER_06: I don't want to ever be like, well, he'd be good in development, but we can't lose him in testing.
880 00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,712 SPEAKER_06: I don't want to be that.
881 00:53:23,893 --> 00:53:26,672 SPEAKER_06: I want to get people where they want to be and where they can really be.
882 00:53:26,652 --> 00:53:29,946 SPEAKER_06: be a star move, so yeah.
883 00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,166 SPEAKER_01: That's why I mentioned that in the beginning.
884 00:53:32,226 --> 00:53:33,321 SPEAKER_01: I'm like, we're not...
885 00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:37,590 SPEAKER_01: The way we have it set up now with the different teams and stuff.
886 00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:42,147 SPEAKER_01: It doesn't have to be what it is going forward.
887 00:53:42,127 --> 00:53:48,036 SPEAKER_01: Like you said, we want to think outside the box if we need to, just to make that process work the best.
888 00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:53,352 SPEAKER_02: There is no box.
889 00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:57,756 SPEAKER_03: We would need a service and information team like
890 00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:02,768 SPEAKER_03: Most of the calls we get from Jeff, it's like they want
891 00:54:02,748 --> 00:54:08,404 SPEAKER_03: information from that database or something that has to be like
892 00:54:08,384 --> 00:54:09,855 SPEAKER_03: done on the database.
893 00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,555 SPEAKER_03: So it would be better to not
894 00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:18,073 SPEAKER_03: like separate from the development team have a service information team
894 00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:18,073 SPEAKER_06: Yeah, yeah.
895 00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:22,984 SPEAKER_03: that could directly address Jeffs and Jordan's goal or any other team.
896 00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:27,102 SPEAKER_06: I think having that division between like
897 00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:30,831 SPEAKER_06: who's actually doing it and delivering it.
898 00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:34,712 SPEAKER_06: and the users is like a huge because I just got an email from Jeff
899 00:54:34,692 --> 00:54:39,100 SPEAKER_06: before this meeting where he wants me to do write a query yeah and he said it
900 00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,723 SPEAKER_06: It has payroll data, so it's like, I know you'll end up having to run it, so can you just do it?
901 00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:47,279 SPEAKER_02: And some of that, I think.
902 00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,208 SPEAKER_06: It's like, because he knows that like,
903 00:54:49,188 --> 00:54:50,398 SPEAKER_06: Ethan can do this.
904 00:54:50,822 --> 00:54:51,911 SPEAKER_06: So I'll just call Ethan.
905 00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:52,698 SPEAKER_06: Chris can do this.
906 00:54:52,758 --> 00:54:53,545 SPEAKER_06: I'll just call Chris.
907 00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:54,470 SPEAKER_06: Jacob can do this.
908 00:54:54,551 --> 00:54:55,315 SPEAKER_06: I'll just call Jacob.
909 00:54:55,436 --> 00:54:56,300 SPEAKER_06: I don't want that.
910 00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:58,050 SPEAKER_06: I want it to go through.
911 00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:01,712 SPEAKER_06: a funnel that's a team and like whoever's talking like
912 00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:03,769 SPEAKER_06: is never the person to actually deliver.
913 00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,442 SPEAKER_06: I don't want Jeff to know who does what.
914 00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:09,576 SPEAKER_06: I want there to be a person or a team he talks to.
915 00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:14,436 SPEAKER_06: I think that's just good across the board anyway, but that's how all this ends up.
916 00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:17,997 SPEAKER_06: In reality, he could have easily sent
917 00:55:17,977 --> 00:55:19,977 SPEAKER_06: this request to a triage team.
918 00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:22,198 SPEAKER_06: It could have gone through this flow and it could've been
919 00:55:22,178 --> 00:55:27,598 SPEAKER_06: handed off to the developer, and even if there's not security to run it on production for the payroll stuff,
920 00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:29,689 SPEAKER_06: It could just be like what you would normally do.
921 00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:31,700 SPEAKER_06: You would just send me a script and say, can you run this?
922 00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,745 SPEAKER_06: I've written everything.
923 00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:36,263 SPEAKER_06: Like it doesn't have to come directly to me or directly to you.
924 00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,112 SPEAKER_02: I don't know how much
925 00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:44,389 SPEAKER_02: We're talking about database, writing database queries and databases in general, and we've got Tuyen
926 00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:46,863 SPEAKER_02: over there who does a fantastic job.
927 00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,941 SPEAKER_02: And she got more involved in it.
928 00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:55,932 SPEAKER_02: A lot of those scripts that you end up writing just because you have access to it.
929 00:55:55,912 --> 00:55:58,935 SPEAKER_02: She's our database admin, so
930 00:55:58,915 --> 00:56:00,001 SPEAKER_02: that'd be awesome.
931 00:56:00,664 --> 00:56:04,082 SPEAKER_02: Include her as part of the teams, as one of the teams.
932 00:56:04,062 --> 00:56:09,735 SPEAKER_01: And even if we had, like in these specific situations where,
933 00:56:09,715 --> 00:56:13,583 SPEAKER_01: like Ethan or whoever's writing these don't have access on production.
934 00:56:15,031 --> 00:56:20,367 SPEAKER_01: Can't we have something, I know we've talked about doing something
935 00:56:20,347 --> 00:56:24,028 SPEAKER_01: in the schism or whatever in the pipelines to where we can throw out
936 00:56:24,008 --> 00:56:28,872 SPEAKER_01: Stuff like that where maybe all you got to do is click approve and then it runs it
936 00:56:24,008 --> 00:56:28,872 SPEAKER_06: I would like that.
937 00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:34,288 SPEAKER_03: In the banking system we used to have this
938 00:56:34,268 --> 00:56:37,461 SPEAKER_03: where whenever we have an issue on production,
939 00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:41,410 SPEAKER_03: We, as a developer of our service, we raise a ticket
940 00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,443 SPEAKER_03: and the ticket directly goes to the in-charge product owner.
941 00:56:45,423 --> 00:56:49,527 SPEAKER_03: And when he approves, he will approve the session.
942 00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:53,762 SPEAKER_03: for a certain time, like one hour, half an hour, whatever the time.
943 00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:55,440 SPEAKER_03: that requires the job.
944 00:56:55,965 --> 00:56:57,238 SPEAKER_03: And once that is done,
945 00:56:57,218 --> 00:57:02,385 SPEAKER_03: We will also have logs that monitor our actions and
946 00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:07,072 SPEAKER_03: Whenever you want you can just see those logs like what this exact user has done.
947 00:57:07,112 --> 00:57:07,313 SPEAKER_02: Yeah
948 00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:09,124 SPEAKER_03: From the security point of view.
949 00:57:09,144 --> 00:57:11,700 SPEAKER_06: Something like that would be great to build out.
950 00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,691 SPEAKER_06: I mean, that's another scalability thing that we're, what we're doing now isn't scalable, it's just what it's always been.
951 00:57:17,671 --> 00:57:23,395 SPEAKER_02: I don't know if this is the right place to ask or not, but I've just always been curious when you write a script like that.
952 00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:28,947 SPEAKER_02: and then you send it to somebody else to run it, don't you kind of feel like you're flying blind a little bit?
953 00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:30,246 SPEAKER_07: Yeah, for sure.
954 00:57:31,727 --> 00:57:31,950 SPEAKER_07: Definitely.
955 00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:35,967 SPEAKER_07: when we're dealing with the employee or payroll data,
956 00:57:35,947 --> 00:57:39,747 SPEAKER_07: it's tricky to know if my script is correct because
957 00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:43,695 SPEAKER_07: Jordan a lot of times knows roughly what number he's looking for than what I'm looking for.
958 00:57:43,675 --> 00:57:49,483 SPEAKER_07: or especially with payroll data is like millions of dollars different because it's all scrambled, you know.
959 00:57:54,172 --> 00:57:57,617 SPEAKER_01: I kind of like that idea, though, that you were talking about, to where it.
960 00:57:57,597 --> 00:58:01,330 SPEAKER_01: you approve like a window of time and then just kind of
961 00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:07,101 SPEAKER_03: After that it just expires and again you have to raise another ticket for that.
961 00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:07,101 SPEAKER_01: And it keeps track of everything that's been done.
961 00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:07,101 SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
962 00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:12,771 SPEAKER_06: And we had a project years ago called like data extract that never got out the door.
963 00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:13,900 SPEAKER_01: I do remember that.
964 00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:16,703 SPEAKER_06: Yeah, but that was the idea of it too, was that
965 00:58:16,683 --> 00:58:21,377 SPEAKER_06: like you could just connect to this, and which it's still,
966 00:58:21,357 --> 00:58:26,575 SPEAKER_06: the end goal of it is still or the the first iteration still kind of living out there but
967 00:58:26,555 --> 00:58:32,008 SPEAKER_06: the users could connect to that service from Excel and just pull
968 00:58:31,988 --> 00:58:37,645 SPEAKER_06: specific views we had written on SQL and they could just load an Excel sheet and manipulate it and then make their own.
969 00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:40,648 SPEAKER_06: export files or whatever they needed to do.
970 00:58:40,628 --> 00:58:45,610 SPEAKER_06: And that was the idea of that was that like a developer could just write a function or a view
971 00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:49,035 SPEAKER_06: let it get deployed and then the user does their own thing if they need.
972 00:58:49,015 --> 00:58:52,562 SPEAKER_03: And also I thought of one more project like
973 00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:55,937 SPEAKER_03: have a service that runs on the production side.
974 00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:59,956 SPEAKER_03: where it just tracks the user actions.
975 00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:01,624 SPEAKER_03: Like for example,
976 00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:06,889 SPEAKER_03: Jeff has done some action, like he went to Check Smith, he did click on this.
977 00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:08,761 SPEAKER_03: and this, this, and that.
978 00:59:08,782 --> 00:59:10,855 SPEAKER_03: And he came across an error.
979 00:59:10,835 --> 00:59:15,259 SPEAKER_03: When he calls us, he'll be explaining the whole thing.
980 00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:21,250 SPEAKER_03: Instead of him explaining those what he has done we can just go to the server log and
981 00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,279 SPEAKER_03: and just make those logs.
982 00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,367 SPEAKER_04: And that would help a little bit with communication too.
983 00:59:25,347 --> 00:59:28,170 SPEAKER_04: Sometimes people are trying to explain what they've done to produce a bug.
984 00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,299 SPEAKER_04: They miss a couple of things.
985 00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:32,657 SPEAKER_03: and they can't replicate that bug anymore
986 00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:35,965 SPEAKER_02: In a limited sense, some of that's...
987 00:59:36,248 --> 00:59:40,740 SPEAKER_02: was done in the database where you would have changed by certain things
987 00:59:36,248 --> 00:59:40,740 SPEAKER_01: Right.
988 00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:45,178 SPEAKER_01: But it's kind of like that confirmation thing that we've been chasing.
989 00:59:45,158 --> 00:59:48,115 SPEAKER_01: what are we missing that she's been doing
990 00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,523 SPEAKER_02: It doesn't catch everything.
991 00:59:49,704 --> 00:59:52,047 SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it just checks, okay,
992 00:59:52,027 --> 00:59:57,531 SPEAKER_02: This data cell got changed, this data row got changed by this person at this time.
993 00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,286 SPEAKER_02: You don't really know much about that.
994 00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:01,564 SPEAKER_02: But it is helpful.
995 01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:06,576 SPEAKER_02: You can at least see, oh, okay, well, I see when the last time the record was changed and by who.
996 01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:09,580 SPEAKER_02: Now we can go back and ask them what they were doing.
996 01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:09,580 SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
997 01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,389 SPEAKER_02: This way, like you're talking about, we wouldn't necessarily have to do that.
998 01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:13,258 SPEAKER_02: We have a record of it.
999 01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:18,557 SPEAKER_06: Make notes of all those things, like the SQL access times.
1000 01:00:18,537 --> 01:00:24,497 SPEAKER_06: the deployment approaches and the like the stack tracing and user step like logging
1001 01:00:24,477 --> 01:00:26,594 SPEAKER_06: All that stuff's good, just take note of it.
1002 01:00:27,098 --> 01:00:29,053 SPEAKER_06: Especially as we go through this with him,
1003 01:00:29,033 --> 01:00:32,057 SPEAKER_06: And we kind of build out what we want our intake and flow to look like.
1004 01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:36,647 SPEAKER_06: if there's pieces like that that may not be directly part of the flow but we need to add in like we need to
1005 01:00:36,627 --> 01:00:38,048 SPEAKER_06: note that and remember it.
1006 01:00:38,109 --> 01:00:39,651 SPEAKER_07: I kind of feel like that's something he'll
1007 01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:44,325 SPEAKER_07: probably identify like if you're talking about with the logging and stuff, like that's somewhere where we're kind of lacking and I feel like
1008 01:00:44,305 --> 01:00:50,316 SPEAKER_07: maybe that's something he'll bring up that'll help us a ton with being able to communicate with the users that we can actually see.
1009 01:00:50,296 --> 01:00:55,227 SPEAKER_07: What's going wrong over the years happened and stuff walking we a lot of times like
1010 01:00:55,207 --> 01:01:01,217 SPEAKER_07: I feel like at least our team, our process is kind of
1011 01:01:01,197 --> 01:01:05,250 SPEAKER_07: I wouldn't say haphazard, but you know, we don't have like a ton of structure with it.
1012 01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:08,946 SPEAKER_07: And so we don't have very specific requirements for how components should be.
1013 01:01:08,926 --> 01:01:13,485 SPEAKER_07: you know, implement and stuff, so everybody does it a little bit differently so on this page we may have good error handling on this one
1014 01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:16,489 SPEAKER_07: We may not, or we may forget to add logging here.
1015 01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:21,079 SPEAKER_07: stuff
1015 01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:21,079 SPEAKER_06: and that's been that's been bittersweet over the years it's been cool because it's it's
1016 01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:24,083 SPEAKER_06: It's granted a lot of flexibility for teams and developers to
1017 01:01:24,063 --> 01:01:30,073 SPEAKER_06: try new things so like we haven't learned hamstrung people on certain technologies but the other time other side of it
1018 01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,164 SPEAKER_06: we ended up having kind of the wild west of technology approach.
1019 01:01:33,508 --> 01:01:34,174 SPEAKER_07: Yeah, absolutely.
1020 01:01:34,154 --> 01:01:37,667 SPEAKER_06: It's opened up doors for like
1021 01:01:37,647 --> 01:01:41,194 SPEAKER_06: learning new things that we wouldn't have learned otherwise but it's also made
1022 01:01:41,174 --> 01:01:42,302 SPEAKER_06: a lot of problems too.
1023 01:01:42,746 --> 01:01:46,695 SPEAKER_02: So are you talking about standardizing how apps are written?
1023 01:01:42,746 --> 01:01:46,695 SPEAKER_07: Not necessarily.
1024 01:01:46,675 --> 01:01:49,817 SPEAKER_02: where everything has to be
1024 01:01:46,675 --> 01:01:49,817 SPEAKER_01: more on the structure.
1025 01:01:49,797 --> 01:01:54,508 SPEAKER_02: Structured and everything has to have a try-catch and everything has to have
1026 01:01:54,488 --> 01:01:56,685 SPEAKER_07: Yeah, I can see it's benefiting from better coding standards.
1027 01:01:56,705 --> 01:01:58,761 SPEAKER_07: Or are you talking more like printing or things like that?
1028 01:01:58,741 --> 01:02:01,849 SPEAKER_07: Yeah, I feel like having better coding standards might be better
1029 01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:05,562 SPEAKER_07: where it doesn't really matter what language you're in, but making sure that, you know,
1030 01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:08,683 SPEAKER_07: If you're writing a service or whatever, you need to have like error handling
1031 01:02:08,663 --> 01:02:11,711 SPEAKER_07: at each step or logging it needs to be in each thing.
1032 01:02:11,792 --> 01:02:12,317 SPEAKER_07: I don't know.
1033 01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:13,003 SPEAKER_07: I just...
1034 01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:17,543 SPEAKER_03: yeah like for example logging it seems like a
1035 01:02:17,523 --> 01:02:21,897 SPEAKER_03: product like we could take over and implement into the apps but
1036 01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:24,431 SPEAKER_03: It's not as easy as we think.
1036 01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:24,431 SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah.
1037 01:02:24,632 --> 01:02:27,769 SPEAKER_03: Sometimes we might have to rewrite the whole app as well.
1038 01:02:27,749 --> 01:02:31,262 SPEAKER_03: because the app was never written to be
1039 01:02:31,242 --> 01:02:36,578 SPEAKER_03: or to include any logging system into it so yeah it's like
1040 01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:40,408 SPEAKER_03: Every user control has to be really done.
1041 01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:44,914 SPEAKER_02: You got WPF and all these different platforms out there that don't talk to each other well.
1042 01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:49,285 SPEAKER_03: Yeah, which again, if you talk to someone like some developer,
1043 01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:54,246 SPEAKER_03: If we had to rewrite this whole app, they would not agree.
1044 01:02:54,226 --> 01:02:57,368 SPEAKER_03: I mean, they would agree, but it's just like, yeah.
1045 01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:03,055 SPEAKER_03: it feels like a big workout a big project and once we
1046 01:03:03,035 --> 01:03:05,230 SPEAKER_03: step into that project.
1047 01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,995 SPEAKER_03: Again, if we are getting calls from Jeff and Jordan,
1048 01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:11,373 SPEAKER_03: It will break the work flow.
1049 01:03:11,756 --> 01:03:14,496 SPEAKER_02: You're going to have somebody to fry that in for you.
1050 01:03:14,476 --> 01:03:15,914 SPEAKER_02: For sure.
1051 01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:19,097 SPEAKER_07: Very optimistic though.
1052 01:03:19,117 --> 01:03:20,492 SPEAKER_02: I love it.
1053 01:03:20,512 --> 01:03:21,482 SPEAKER_01: Lot's of good talking points.
1054 01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:27,473 SPEAKER_06: I think Zach got the user set up.
1055 01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:33,193 SPEAKER_06: You're probably good to get the user's phone and whatnot from.
1056 01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:36,906 SPEAKER_01: You can ask about the log and everything.
