WEBVTT

00:01.364 --> 00:02.279
Thank you.

00:16.028 --> 00:18.951
Are you entirely able to use production materials or something?

00:34.625 --> 00:37.648
[SPEAKER_09]: Conrad needs to hurry back and get that clock adjusted again.

00:38.715 --> 00:40.146
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pull off.

00:42.978 --> 00:44.533
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a few minutes.

00:49.998 --> 00:52.718
[SPEAKER_07]: Ben was trying to set the wind of church a little fast.

00:53.626 --> 00:56.920
[SPEAKER_07]: So the pastor gets done quicker.

00:58.132 --> 01:00.075
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially during football season.

01:01.658 --> 01:06.893
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you referring to the clock that is inside the clock text?

01:07.413 --> 01:09.559
[SPEAKER_02]: That is all too.

01:09.580 --> 01:09.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

01:09.863 --> 01:09.964
Yeah.

01:11.885 --> 01:12.850
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

01:13.252 --> 01:13.553
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

01:13.875 --> 01:16.046
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean the wall clock.

01:16.066 --> 01:17.895
[SPEAKER_02]: The clock text is a little bit off.

01:17.875 --> 01:21.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a bad day.

01:23.410 --> 01:25.607
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big gap between five and six.

01:29.165 --> 01:32.188
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we should have bought a better cloth.

01:32.168 --> 01:34.066
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're going for the gimmick.

01:34.167 --> 01:36.508
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the word clock at the top middle.

01:36.488 --> 01:41.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is like there's a bump between L.O.C.

01:41.078 --> 01:44.661
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, do you know those projections as we sit on the table?

01:44.681 --> 01:45.587
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up there

01:48.672 --> 01:50.726
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi folks, I'm sorry I'm a little late.

01:50.988 --> 01:52.962
[SPEAKER_09]: You are not late compared to our cloud.

01:52.942 --> 01:56.624
[SPEAKER_07]: Just discussing that.

01:56.644 --> 01:57.670
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on time.

01:57.650 --> 02:01.180
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Krishna, everyone.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.994
[SPEAKER_09]: Krishna, welcome folks.

02:03.739 --> 02:05.472
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to meet you.

02:05.915 --> 02:06.681
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

02:06.661 --> 02:10.815
[SPEAKER_09]: So this meeting is basically just

02:10.795 --> 02:16.806
[SPEAKER_09]: Introducing everybody, kind of getting our feet wet on what we're doing and what we want to do.

02:16.786 --> 02:21.700
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah just go from there see where it takes us

02:21.680 --> 02:26.509
[SPEAKER_09]: So Krishna, just to give you some

02:26.489 --> 02:27.675
[SPEAKER_09]: Introductions to us.

02:28.841 --> 02:29.746
[SPEAKER_09]: You already know Chris.

02:30.811 --> 02:31.977
[SPEAKER_09]: Men on the yellow.

02:31.957 --> 02:34.416
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Adam.

02:34.496 --> 02:35.363
[SPEAKER_09]: You've already met me.

02:35.383 --> 02:37.056
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't met me in person yet.

02:37.036 --> 02:40.836
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope...

02:40.816 --> 02:44.886
[SPEAKER_09]: lead the development team here in the CAPE office.

02:44.866 --> 02:49.257
[SPEAKER_09]: and we've got a few remote users also.

02:49.237 --> 02:52.615
[SPEAKER_09]: Ethan is our

02:52.595 --> 02:56.766
[SPEAKER_09]: leader of the finance team, which is the one that we're

02:56.746 --> 02:59.770
[SPEAKER_09]: kinda gonna get our feet wet with you on.

02:59.750 --> 03:05.406
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Ethan is leader of Psy.

03:05.386 --> 03:10.182
[SPEAKER_09]: And here, and then we got Matt and Travis both remote.

03:10.634 --> 03:12.696
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're also on 8-15.

03:13.013 --> 03:16.881
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also in the room I've got Scott here.

03:16.861 --> 03:20.661
[SPEAKER_09]: leading our triage team slash

03:20.641 --> 03:24.964
[SPEAKER_09]: IT support guy for any tickets that come in and we're

03:24.944 --> 03:27.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of building that as we go also.

03:27.381 --> 03:30.482
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that we just started.

03:30.462 --> 03:36.287
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Chris Kelly at the end of the table is leading our automation

03:36.267 --> 03:38.565
[SPEAKER_09]: testing team.

03:38.887 --> 03:39.532
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.265
[SPEAKER_09]: And then along with him we've got

03:41.245 --> 03:42.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Mason?

03:42.946 --> 03:44.809
[SPEAKER_09]: Mason is on his team.

03:44.789 --> 03:49.585
[SPEAKER_09]: he's gonna start focusing on the finance guys

03:49.565 --> 03:54.563
[SPEAKER_09]: programs and then Matt Hendricks on the call also is

03:54.543 --> 03:59.035
[SPEAKER_09]: the leader of our manual testing team.

03:59.015 --> 04:04.857
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, him and Chris work heavily together on the testing side of things.

04:04.837 --> 04:06.776
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

04:07.463 --> 04:09.058
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, guys.

04:09.038 --> 04:11.591
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to apologize in advance if I ask again.

04:11.611 --> 04:12.757
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no problem.

04:13.039 --> 04:15.049
[SPEAKER_00]: We make notes of all the names, but

04:15.029 --> 04:16.740
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you guys do?

04:16.760 --> 04:19.538
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's something written up somewhere that you have

04:19.518 --> 04:21.287
[SPEAKER_00]: We can write that up for you.

04:22.212 --> 04:25.107
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we can do that.

04:25.542 --> 04:28.735
[SPEAKER_09]: Krishna, do you want to say anything about yourself at all?

04:28.715 --> 04:31.992
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just quickly introduce myself from my background.

04:31.972 --> 04:37.780
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out my career as a software developer way back at Oracle.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.492
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that was right after grad school.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.333
[SPEAKER_00]: through science masters.

04:43.414 --> 04:45.441
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I decided I was going to work at Oracle.

04:45.421 --> 04:49.204
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great place to be and practice all the software.

04:49.184 --> 04:53.946
[SPEAKER_00]: back then, you know, practices that had learned in grad school and all that.

04:54.398 --> 04:57.017
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I decided I wanted to work at

04:57.301 --> 05:02.687
[SPEAKER_00]: small medium-sized companies and I have since then worked at many different companies

05:02.667 --> 05:08.678
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got an MBA and moved away from software engineering software development.

05:08.658 --> 05:12.947
[SPEAKER_00]: into more the client side of the business where

05:12.927 --> 05:17.993
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to customers, you talk to users of your software,

05:18.293 --> 05:22.195
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what the pain points are, and then you

05:22.175 --> 05:25.975
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would go talk to the engineering teams and say,

05:25.955 --> 05:27.409
[SPEAKER_00]: the requirements.

05:27.450 --> 05:29.772
[SPEAKER_00]: That's broadly speaking what I do.

05:29.752 --> 05:34.345
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot more of that to the product function.

05:34.325 --> 05:39.171
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that is most relevant here is

05:39.151 --> 05:44.520
[SPEAKER_00]: Since about 2013, I have been involved in

05:44.500 --> 05:49.515
[SPEAKER_00]: Agile teams and agile means

05:49.782 --> 05:51.238
[SPEAKER_00]: many different things to do.

05:51.622 --> 05:56.569
[SPEAKER_00]: every company that tries to practice it.

05:56.549 --> 05:59.573
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many variations of

05:59.553 --> 06:05.344
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no correct agile leverage from what I have seen in my

06:05.324 --> 06:08.567
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 years of doing this.

06:08.547 --> 06:11.571
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really something that, you know,

06:11.551 --> 06:15.402
[SPEAKER_00]: you adopt and it works for your

06:15.382 --> 06:19.485
[SPEAKER_00]: your attorney team, as well as your clients that you serve.

06:19.465 --> 06:21.860
[SPEAKER_00]: finance in a company, one client.

06:22.061 --> 06:25.341
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many other clients in your company.

06:25.861 --> 06:30.387
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but the key elements of this is trying to,

06:30.367 --> 06:33.390
[SPEAKER_00]: For all our additional conversations,

06:33.370 --> 06:38.790
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had last time, it seems like there's a little frustration in the minds of

06:38.770 --> 06:44.663
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of what they are getting versus what they thought they asked

06:44.643 --> 06:47.579
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a gap, it seems like.

06:48.544 --> 06:50.333
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've...

06:50.313 --> 06:53.539
[SPEAKER_00]: experience prior.

06:53.519 --> 06:56.830
[SPEAKER_00]: teams is the product function.

06:56.810 --> 07:01.943
[SPEAKER_00]: the product manager, my role is really to be the go between you guys

07:01.923 --> 07:07.731
[SPEAKER_00]: and the clients and what that means is I am talking to these folks, the clients,

07:07.711 --> 07:11.528
[SPEAKER_00]: on a fairly regular basis, and regular is the key thing.

07:11.508 --> 07:14.532
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, regularly I go talk to them,

07:14.512 --> 07:18.498
[SPEAKER_00]: get a sense of, hey, what are your pain points with what you're using right now?

07:18.518 --> 07:19.645
[SPEAKER_00]: What's not working?

07:19.625 --> 07:20.737
[SPEAKER_00]: What is working?

07:21.323 --> 07:23.020
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to change, right?

07:23.000 --> 07:26.682
[SPEAKER_00]: And I translate those conversations into

07:28.163 --> 07:31.592
[SPEAKER_00]: Agile Speak, which would work for you guys.

07:31.572 --> 07:33.380
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the user personas?

07:33.420 --> 07:34.505
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the epics?

07:34.685 --> 07:37.397
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the user stories in these epics?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.642
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the examples criteria?

07:40.124 --> 07:43.843
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you put together a UX and a markup of what

07:43.823 --> 07:45.520
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing should look like.

07:46.369 --> 07:48.147
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we

07:48.127 --> 07:51.150
[SPEAKER_00]: work together, you guys in the room and myself,

07:51.130 --> 07:56.128
[SPEAKER_00]: and we put them back to develop what these guys want.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.839
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, what?

07:58.323 --> 08:01.866
[SPEAKER_00]: The word regular will keep coming up, which is really key.

08:01.846 --> 08:06.692
[SPEAKER_00]: that gap between what they think they asked for and what they got.

08:06.672 --> 08:11.029
[SPEAKER_00]: That gap should not exist and it really didn't.

08:11.009 --> 08:16.885
[SPEAKER_00]: keep coming up from time to time because people, if you have a conversation on day one,

08:16.865 --> 08:22.875
[SPEAKER_00]: And on day 45, you deliver something to these clients

08:22.855 --> 08:26.554
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot of days that have passed between

08:26.534 --> 08:29.946
[SPEAKER_00]: what they thought they wanted and what they think they're getting.

08:29.926 --> 08:33.207
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gap needs to reduce.

08:33.227 --> 08:35.059
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is, okay,

08:35.393 --> 08:40.847
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do sprints, is it a two-week sprint, is it a week sprint, whatever it is,

08:41.232 --> 08:46.669
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up with an iterative development process where

08:46.649 --> 08:52.660
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you haven't completely delivered all of the bells and whistles, all the buttons in the UI,

08:52.640 --> 08:55.731
[SPEAKER_00]: you at least give them

08:56.251 --> 09:00.017
[SPEAKER_00]: a UI that has the

08:59.997 --> 09:03.291
[SPEAKER_00]: major elements in it so that they can start looking at it

09:03.271 --> 09:05.630
[SPEAKER_00]: after the first week, after the second week, whatever it is.

09:05.872 --> 09:07.324
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking to them.

09:07.743 --> 09:10.800
[SPEAKER_00]: you know every week let's say uh and so

09:10.780 --> 09:15.053
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to think of that is iterative versus incremental.

09:15.033 --> 09:19.457
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a classic, and if you Google it, you'll find it.

09:19.437 --> 09:24.368
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mona Lisa painting, there's two ways to develop the Mona Lisa painting.

09:24.348 --> 09:29.397
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the iterative process where you draw an outline of the entire

09:29.377 --> 09:31.072
[SPEAKER_00]: Mona Lisa in the painting.

09:31.819 --> 09:33.514
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's the first

09:33.494 --> 09:36.518
[SPEAKER_00]: from this brick, first brick.

09:36.498 --> 09:40.146
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every subsequent sprint you start to fill it out.

09:40.126 --> 09:45.057
[SPEAKER_00]: You put more colors in paintings and color the hair.

09:45.037 --> 09:46.452
[SPEAKER_00]: the face and all that stuff.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.938
[SPEAKER_00]: But the client

09:49.357 --> 09:54.912
[SPEAKER_00]: sees that initial drop from the first sprint and they're like,

09:54.892 --> 10:00.042
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no gap between what they thought they wanted versus what they're starting to get.

10:00.022 --> 10:05.509
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in each subsequent sprint, you iterate through and you start building out the painting.

10:05.489 --> 10:09.103
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of it, they see what they've got.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.551
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's one approach.

10:10.571 --> 10:15.094
[SPEAKER_00]: The other approach is IKRA metal where you tape the top left corner of the Mona Lisa paint

10:15.074 --> 10:17.997
[SPEAKER_00]: You fill out all the details of, you know,

10:18.213 --> 10:22.232
[SPEAKER_00]: her face, or maybe just the face, right, in the first break.

10:22.212 --> 10:25.708
[SPEAKER_00]: but none of the other parts of the painting.

10:25.688 --> 10:30.518
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you show that to the client and they're like, wait a minute, this is not what I asked for.

10:30.498 --> 10:32.673
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gap starts to develop, right?

10:32.874 --> 10:36.357
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my long-winded way of saying, you know,

10:36.337 --> 10:40.592
[SPEAKER_00]: My role here will be to help you guys get some kind of a process

10:40.572 --> 10:45.874
[SPEAKER_00]: where we start to do an iterative process

10:45.854 --> 10:51.865
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery to these clients so that there is no gap or if there is a gap it is fairly quickly

10:51.845 --> 10:54.123
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed block.

10:54.143 --> 10:55.493
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.

10:55.473 --> 11:01.433
[SPEAKER_00]: from the initial conversation that may seem like the pain point in the process, but I don't know.

11:01.413 --> 11:06.073
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my value add here, so I'll stop talking.

11:06.053 --> 11:11.912
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts or any reactions?

11:11.892 --> 11:17.295
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds great, honestly.

11:17.275 --> 11:19.969
[SPEAKER_03]: We could definitely use some more structure like that.

11:20.411 --> 11:23.286
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the thing that I'm curious about most

11:23.266 --> 11:27.302
[SPEAKER_03]: is seeing how this will fit into our team

11:27.282 --> 11:33.073
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of the teams here deal with this but like I think for ours it's

11:33.053 --> 11:36.398
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst is that we support, I guess,

11:36.378 --> 11:40.566
[SPEAKER_03]: probably like three or four main groups of users which I guess

11:40.546 --> 11:46.371
[SPEAKER_03]: about the finance side of things, but we also deal with some of the HR stuff and sales.

11:46.351 --> 11:50.910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of curious how that's going to look with like sprints and stuff whenever we have

11:50.890 --> 11:54.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of tiny little things to do on all these different apps and different

11:54.248 --> 11:57.795
[SPEAKER_03]: times versus working on one big feature or epic at a time?

11:57.775 --> 11:59.569
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of curious, I guess.

12:00.194 --> 12:02.875
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we want to start small.

12:02.855 --> 12:08.207
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is if right now you're saying the finance and accounting team is

12:08.187 --> 12:10.097
[SPEAKER_00]: that client is

12:10.634 --> 12:15.953
[SPEAKER_00]: the most hopeful, let's say, or the one that's had, that's been most...

12:16.321 --> 12:18.889
[SPEAKER_00]: make the most noise, let's start with acting, right?

12:19.072 --> 12:24.137
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus on what their needs are or what their

12:24.117 --> 12:29.908
[SPEAKER_00]: points are and focus on trying to

12:29.888 --> 12:34.988
[SPEAKER_00]: internally our process, setting it up so that we can

12:34.968 --> 12:39.021
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, reduce this gap between what they think they ask for

12:39.001 --> 12:41.427
[SPEAKER_00]: when they get it, what they think they ask for.

12:41.629 --> 12:42.902
[SPEAKER_00]: That gap needs to

12:42.882 --> 12:46.041
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and we need to get rid of that gap.

12:46.021 --> 12:51.964
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we're gonna do that is, well, I'm jumping ahead, I have to dive into your process and all that stuff.

12:51.944 --> 12:55.192
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to get that gap reduced.

12:55.212 --> 12:56.402
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with that.

12:56.382 --> 12:59.442
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you're serving more than one client.

12:59.543 --> 13:01.093
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just use the word client.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.245
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, user groups.

13:04.311 --> 13:06.966
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we have this working

13:06.946 --> 13:12.957
[SPEAKER_00]: prove this as a proof point, this process that we're putting in place, it works.

13:12.937 --> 13:14.047
[SPEAKER_00]: this client.

13:14.107 --> 13:17.496
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's then go find the next client.

13:17.476 --> 13:19.591
[SPEAKER_00]: and then refine.

13:19.752 --> 13:23.318
[SPEAKER_00]: And so starting small would be the best way to do this.

13:23.298 --> 13:28.414
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll find that we have to, each iteration, I don't know

13:29.407 --> 13:32.937
[SPEAKER_00]: So every sprint, we have a retrospective.

13:32.917 --> 13:35.940
[SPEAKER_00]: We stop and say, hey, what worked?

13:35.920 --> 13:39.241
[SPEAKER_00]: what did not work, what needs to change, right?

13:39.342 --> 13:40.328
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we,

13:40.865 --> 13:45.188
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three questions we ask, and so we ask those questions.

13:45.168 --> 13:50.166
[SPEAKER_00]: of ourselves and then go around the room and just

13:50.956 --> 13:55.212
[SPEAKER_00]: take that feedback and tweak the process and go to the next spring.

13:55.192 --> 13:58.090
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to be useful.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.168
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we have something working for one

14:01.148 --> 14:04.189
[SPEAKER_00]: client, then we go off and

14:04.169 --> 14:08.728
[SPEAKER_00]: work with the next team, next team, next team.

14:08.708 --> 14:09.923
[SPEAKER_00]: roll this out.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.171
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of

14:12.151 --> 14:14.226
[SPEAKER_00]: of the product management function.

14:14.306 --> 14:16.542
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned this to Christopher as well.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.558
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one person and I have only so many hours with you guys.

14:20.538 --> 14:25.924
[SPEAKER_00]: We may bring in more faults, but let's first prove this as a process that it works.

14:26.292 --> 14:31.780
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can look at rolling this out to other teams and other clients.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.279
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?

14:33.542 --> 14:34.817
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

14:34.797 --> 14:40.048
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to add to that, something that we're keeping in mind as a

14:40.028 --> 14:45.178
[SPEAKER_09]: an overall team, I say team,

14:45.158 --> 14:49.600
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess is better used for that.

14:49.580 --> 14:53.346
[SPEAKER_09]: The team structure is and has been

14:53.326 --> 14:57.345
[SPEAKER_09]: the way it has been for I don't know how many years now, four or five?

14:57.325 --> 15:01.446
[SPEAKER_09]: We're open-minded on if

15:01.426 --> 15:05.310
[SPEAKER_09]: the team structure the way it is currently

15:05.290 --> 15:09.495
[SPEAKER_09]: housed to where we have roughly four

15:09.475 --> 15:12.499
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess three or four guys on each team.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.739
[SPEAKER_09]: that will work on this group of applications.

15:15.719 --> 15:20.802
[SPEAKER_09]: If it makes more sense to do it a different way, whether it's

15:20.782 --> 15:24.058
[SPEAKER_09]: just blowing it all up and not have teams and just.

15:24.038 --> 15:29.323
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of give a project to a certain amount of people or developers or

15:29.303 --> 15:34.015
[SPEAKER_09]: it down into smaller teams to where they're focused more on certain things.

15:33.995 --> 15:39.550
[SPEAKER_09]: We're open to anything like that, so just keep that in your mind if we're

15:39.530 --> 15:44.022
[SPEAKER_09]: if we get into talking about these things and you notice that

15:44.002 --> 15:47.363
[SPEAKER_09]: like the ones that are more vocal,

15:47.343 --> 15:53.252
[SPEAKER_09]: are always going to be the ones that get their applications worked on the most.

15:53.232 --> 15:56.652
[SPEAKER_09]: think about it a little bit different on the team side.

15:56.873 --> 15:57.758
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

15:57.738 --> 16:03.040
[SPEAKER_00]: the advantage of just doing this small approach is

16:03.712 --> 16:08.406
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got an existing, the analogy I use is,

16:08.386 --> 16:12.298
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on a cruise in the middle of the Pacific.

16:12.318 --> 16:13.367
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on a ship.

16:13.347 --> 16:18.987
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're trying to change an engine part because there's something not working with.

16:19.743 --> 16:22.638
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ship needs to keep going.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.488
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot just stop the ship

16:24.468 --> 16:26.705
[SPEAKER_00]: replace the entire engine and then start again.

16:26.766 --> 16:28.842
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep cruising.

16:29.142 --> 16:35.085
[SPEAKER_00]: uh so you take a small part of that engine you replace it and then hopefully that

16:35.065 --> 16:40.587
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfies the people on deck that were complaining about that engine park.

16:40.567 --> 16:45.919
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have to stop everything or start plugging things willy-nilly

16:45.899 --> 16:48.359
[SPEAKER_00]: where everybody on desktop is complaining.

16:48.380 --> 16:50.880
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want all your client teams

16:50.860 --> 16:52.996
[SPEAKER_00]: getting really mad at you.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.483
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just take the really small piece.

16:56.463 --> 16:59.824
[SPEAKER_00]: and replace that engine in

16:59.804 --> 17:02.039
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of your cruise, so.

17:02.825 --> 17:04.617
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that makes it easy.

17:04.597 --> 17:09.595
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, thank you that you can stand back once we have

17:09.575 --> 17:15.585
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two or three clients happy with whatever process we end up with

17:15.565 --> 17:20.479
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can step back and say, is there a more efficient way to deliver

17:20.459 --> 17:25.204
[SPEAKER_00]: what these clients are asking for and maybe the

17:25.184 --> 17:30.351
[SPEAKER_00]: arrange the teams or broader process, but that's.

17:30.533 --> 17:33.073
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a zest, you know, it's like small.

17:33.094 --> 17:33.658
[SPEAKER_09]: That works.

17:33.638 --> 17:39.649
[SPEAKER_09]: Just going through some of the lists that you sent out in the meeting invite.

17:39.629 --> 17:45.353
[SPEAKER_09]: We are getting you an account set up and a VM to remote into to kind of look at

17:45.333 --> 17:49.842
[SPEAKER_09]: everything we have, so that'll be shortcoming.

17:50.767 --> 17:54.988
[SPEAKER_09]: The next one was walk through existing functionality.

17:55.069 --> 17:56.777
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how deep I want to get into that.

17:56.757 --> 17:58.345
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

17:59.008 --> 18:02.042
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think this may have to wait for a little bit.

18:02.022 --> 18:05.847
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm trying to do is to get my arms around all of this stuff.

18:05.888 --> 18:07.780
[SPEAKER_00]: The people, the processes,

18:07.760 --> 18:12.758
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology, what you guys have built, all that stuff.

18:12.738 --> 18:18.748
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I have the login, maybe you can, once I have the setup, maybe something.

18:18.728 --> 18:21.752
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you could walk me through what's, you know,

18:21.732 --> 18:26.306
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're using, the client, the accounting team?

18:26.427 --> 18:26.528
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

18:26.508 --> 18:30.021
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also want to dive into the process that

18:30.001 --> 18:34.003
[SPEAKER_00]: your team is using, you know,

18:33.983 --> 18:37.682
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, you mentioned you guys use Jira as well.

18:37.662 --> 18:42.880
[SPEAKER_00]: if i can get my content here i would look at uh

18:43.147 --> 18:49.157
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we also have it synced up to the DevOps side where these guys mainly work out of.

18:49.137 --> 18:55.148
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also have a Confluence knowledge base.

18:55.128 --> 19:00.092
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a confluence knowledge base that's tied into that as well.

19:00.460 --> 19:04.902
[SPEAKER_00]: And do the clients take a look at the conference pages at all?

19:04.882 --> 19:07.420
[SPEAKER_09]: No, those are mostly internally for now.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.998
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

19:11.378 --> 19:16.090
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we really have any KBs out there for that kind of stuff.

19:16.070 --> 19:20.359
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah those are mostly just internal for us as developers.

19:21.824 --> 19:25.000
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so in terms of community,

19:25.705 --> 19:29.303
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe this is diving into the process now, but

19:30.110 --> 19:33.741
[SPEAKER_00]: when you either you've got

19:33.721 --> 19:37.099
[SPEAKER_00]: certain set of features that economy wants now

19:37.535 --> 19:42.212
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you talk a little bit about the process that exists now

19:42.378 --> 19:46.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, currently, usually what we'll do is

19:46.327 --> 19:50.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the time, the clients will reach out to me

19:50.950 --> 19:55.965
[SPEAKER_03]: and they'll kind of explain what they want and we'll talk through it and stuff and then I will go

19:55.945 --> 19:59.560
[SPEAKER_03]: either onto JIRA, we've started using that more now,

19:59.540 --> 20:04.048
[SPEAKER_03]: or sometimes directly into DevOps, but we'll create the work items there like user stories or

20:04.028 --> 20:07.170
[SPEAKER_03]: issues, you know, depending on what it is.

20:07.150 --> 20:11.423
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll communicate, like, so our team, the finance team,

20:11.403 --> 20:17.413
[SPEAKER_03]: meet like every morning around I think 8.30 we kind of discuss like what we're working on currently and

20:17.393 --> 20:20.738
[SPEAKER_03]: what we did the day before.

20:20.718 --> 20:24.754
[SPEAKER_03]: that's usually when we'll kind of figure out who's gonna work on what

20:24.734 --> 20:28.281
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll just put that into an iteration but we don't have like a very

20:28.261 --> 20:31.285
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess structured process.

20:31.265 --> 20:35.048
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried on our most recent project to follow something

20:35.028 --> 20:38.305
[SPEAKER_03]: more agile like where we did sprints like we did like one month sprints

20:38.285 --> 20:42.979
[SPEAKER_03]: But typically we just kind of work on these as they come in and then we'll group.

20:42.959 --> 20:48.565
[SPEAKER_03]: group up a couple of issues or user stories together into one release and then push it out and

20:48.545 --> 20:54.555
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually at that point we'll communicate either over teams or phone call with the users and let them know that that's out.

20:54.535 --> 20:58.572
[SPEAKER_00]: Just diving into the actual intake itself,

20:58.855 --> 21:03.820
[SPEAKER_00]: So the client folks know to contact you.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.892
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the point of contact for things that they want.

21:06.912 --> 21:07.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

21:07.985 --> 21:09.791
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just call you?

21:09.831 --> 21:11.008
[SPEAKER_00]: Not anymore.

21:10.988 --> 21:16.105
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get away from that.

21:16.085 --> 21:19.193
[SPEAKER_04]: Which that flow is part of like

21:19.173 --> 21:22.821
[SPEAKER_04]: What we were reaching out to you for like look at this

21:22.801 --> 21:25.926
[SPEAKER_04]: what Ethan described and that flow had been

21:25.906 --> 21:30.499
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, detrimental might be an overstatement, but it really impacted

21:30.479 --> 21:33.823
[SPEAKER_04]: his personal workflow and his team's workflow.

21:33.803 --> 21:38.025
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been trying to move that up like what Adam had said Scott's been doing.

21:38.005 --> 21:43.999
[SPEAKER_04]: he and his team are triaging those calls, but a lot of the

21:43.979 --> 21:49.990
[SPEAKER_04]: migration to that hasn't been super smooth with the with the user base because they

21:49.970 --> 21:55.238
[SPEAKER_04]: they have this feeling that really Ethan's the only person they can talk to and so

21:55.218 --> 21:59.558
[SPEAKER_04]: so what's ended up happening a lot of times they'll call Scott and Scott will attempt to

21:59.538 --> 22:03.709
[SPEAKER_04]: troubleshoot the problem and at the end of the day they'll just say, we need to talk to Ethan.

22:04.043 --> 22:07.810
[SPEAKER_09]: Just growing pains on knowledge.

22:07.790 --> 22:11.877
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're working on trying to like, and Scott's been doing a great job on

22:11.857 --> 22:15.117
[SPEAKER_04]: gathering as much information as he can to kind of

22:15.097 --> 22:18.846
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess prime Ethan for what's coming.

22:18.826 --> 22:22.407
[SPEAKER_04]: but we haven't quite made that transition yet to where

22:22.387 --> 22:25.326
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan's not having to feel so much of that himself.

22:25.947 --> 22:31.958
[SPEAKER_00]: And Scott, how often do you meet with these folks, with the client team, the accounting folks?

22:31.938 --> 22:34.200
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I haven't yet.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.058
[SPEAKER_09]: So you haven't?

22:36.038 --> 22:40.041
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically when they're calling is when we're meeting them.

22:40.477 --> 22:44.260
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have a good working relationship with most of them.

22:44.240 --> 22:49.710
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been to some of the plants and some of the teams, but not all of them.

22:50.348 --> 22:51.275
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

22:51.295 --> 22:56.292
[SPEAKER_00]: The accounting folks specifically, how often do they

22:56.727 --> 22:59.751
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're the ones that are most vocal right now, but

22:59.731 --> 23:01.445
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do they vocalize?

23:01.566 --> 23:03.784
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get a sense of, you know,

23:03.764 --> 23:06.275
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual intake process in detail.

23:06.757 --> 23:09.690
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they just call you Ethan every day?

23:09.670 --> 23:12.880
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like.

23:12.860 --> 23:17.841
[SPEAKER_02]: how often they run into a problem.

23:17.821 --> 23:22.161
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't usually put in tickets like as soon as they run into an issue usually they will

23:22.141 --> 23:25.165
[SPEAKER_03]: call directly and ask to speak to me.

23:25.145 --> 23:28.168
[SPEAKER_03]: or sometimes Psy now, but

23:28.148 --> 23:32.488
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd say it depends, but anywhere from...

23:32.468 --> 23:36.673
[SPEAKER_03]: three to 20 times a week, it just really depends.

23:36.653 --> 23:41.213
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah sometimes it'll be seven or eight times in a single day.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.966
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to use emails to communicate, right?

23:44.986 --> 23:46.478
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically phone calls.

23:46.458 --> 23:46.941
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

23:47.082 --> 23:48.511
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their preferred guess.

23:48.532 --> 23:48.833
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

23:49.337 --> 23:51.692
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to get

23:51.672 --> 23:56.012
[SPEAKER_07]: them to go through me right now they call one number

23:55.992 --> 24:01.075
[SPEAKER_07]: and it comes to Adam or I, and we get an issue put in,

24:01.055 --> 24:02.505
[SPEAKER_07]: if they'll explain it to us.

24:03.713 --> 24:06.593
[SPEAKER_07]: Many times it will be, I just need to talk to Ethan.

24:06.573 --> 24:12.027
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been trying to keep notes on those types of things and

24:12.007 --> 24:17.157
[SPEAKER_07]: when I can ahead of time to keep a history of what's going on.

24:17.508 --> 24:20.506
[SPEAKER_04]: And for minors, those calls could be anything, too.

24:20.788 --> 24:22.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

24:22.317 --> 24:25.341
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be like almost a network down.

24:25.321 --> 24:29.070
[SPEAKER_04]: issue that they're experiencing that really needs to be looked at now.

24:29.050 --> 24:33.604
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be something they're thinking of on the current most recent release.

24:33.684 --> 24:34.369
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be

24:34.349 --> 24:38.368
[SPEAKER_04]: little thing that's bugging them or it could just be a hypothetical like hey

24:38.348 --> 24:40.204
[SPEAKER_04]: what if we decide to do this, is that doable?

24:40.506 --> 24:41.777
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it can range.

24:41.757 --> 24:43.814
[SPEAKER_04]: of any of those things.

24:43.834 --> 24:44.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even sometimes like,

24:44.963 --> 24:49.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, hey, can you write me like a query, like a SQL query that will find this information?

24:49.679 --> 24:50.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

24:50.385 --> 24:50.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

24:50.667 --> 24:53.860
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one time I had a call that was like,

24:53.840 --> 24:59.766
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan literally just fixed it right as I answered the call, so it was great.

24:59.746 --> 25:03.597
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that is

25:03.577 --> 25:09.115
[SPEAKER_02]: natural behavior to them i mean even for us if we have some credit card issue

25:09.095 --> 25:10.836
[SPEAKER_02]: that charge cord

25:11.761 --> 25:16.911
[SPEAKER_02]: by some reason we just want to get to the direct person and

25:16.891 --> 25:21.585
[SPEAKER_02]: get it resolved instead of writing emails or chatting through a customer.

25:21.565 --> 25:24.842
[SPEAKER_09]: They have that avenue, that's what they want.

25:24.902 --> 25:27.576
[SPEAKER_07]: They get requests through email, Teams, Slack.

25:27.556 --> 25:31.592
[SPEAKER_07]: There are various ways this happens.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.917
[SPEAKER_07]: it will bypass the initial triage intake.

25:34.897 --> 25:38.832
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say that's been a hurdle for us like doing in house

25:38.812 --> 25:43.219
[SPEAKER_04]: any in-house IT since as long as I've been here is that

25:43.975 --> 25:48.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime I've tried to operate or do something like an IT shop would

25:48.835 --> 25:52.062
[SPEAKER_04]: like a third party IT shop providing a service.

25:52.042 --> 25:57.073
[SPEAKER_04]: where we kind of set up the contractual guidelines and we define the flow.

25:57.053 --> 26:00.752
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a struggle here because

26:00.732 --> 26:06.743
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying we're not on the same team, we are all on the same team, but there's this tendency to believe that

26:06.723 --> 26:10.860
[SPEAKER_04]: any sort of structure or hierarchy we want to

26:10.840 --> 26:15.332
[SPEAKER_04]: put in is a roadblock to us really working together.

26:15.532 --> 26:21.475
[SPEAKER_04]: We all work for WW, so if the accounting team has a question, they should just be able to call and talk to

26:21.455 --> 26:24.953
[SPEAKER_04]: any developer they want because we're all working for the same team.

26:24.973 --> 26:25.696
[SPEAKER_04]: They're dedicated.

26:25.777 --> 26:27.465
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a team dedicated to them

26:27.445 --> 26:33.456
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as soon as we put in any structure of like, well, you need to call this number or email this ticket in,

26:33.436 --> 26:37.202
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, well, no, that's impacting my workflow.

26:37.182 --> 26:41.623
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to do that because we're all on the same team here.

26:41.603 --> 26:42.877
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see what I mean.

26:42.937 --> 26:43.281
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

26:44.312 --> 26:45.100
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had trouble offering.

26:45.080 --> 26:48.559
[SPEAKER_04]: operating as a software shop and I'm not saying we should

26:48.539 --> 26:51.647
[SPEAKER_04]: operate everything as if we're a third party.

26:51.627 --> 26:54.988
[SPEAKER_04]: We've hit resistance there in the past.

26:55.390 --> 26:58.887
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big problem because it's not

26:58.867 --> 27:02.548
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it impacts the client's workflow.

27:02.950 --> 27:08.775
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side, it is affecting Ethan and all the delivery teams.

27:08.755 --> 27:14.142
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affecting your workflow if you are working on something and get interrupted, right?

27:14.510 --> 27:18.563
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, it's not an optimal situation.

27:18.543 --> 27:23.659
[SPEAKER_00]: probably because we may have to take this offline to bubble this up.

27:23.639 --> 27:27.793
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a process change.

27:27.773 --> 27:30.797
[SPEAKER_00]: that will need to get signed up from

27:30.777 --> 27:34.662
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I would hope that at the end of the day I feel like if we

27:34.642 --> 27:39.066
[SPEAKER_04]: If we do like what you described well and we build out this product

27:39.046 --> 27:43.943
[SPEAKER_04]: product management system well yeah i think that a lot of the other

27:43.923 --> 27:46.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, they're not hard enough.

27:46.927 --> 27:47.510
[SPEAKER_04]: to work with.

27:47.570 --> 27:51.773
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean they easily acknowledge that they want to be respectful of these guys time just as

27:51.753 --> 27:55.333
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're not, they're not

27:55.313 --> 28:01.324
[SPEAKER_04]: problematic in that sense, but I think that that gap in expectations you were talking about

28:01.304 --> 28:07.315
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like if we can close that and really do product management well and customer service well, I think that it will

28:07.295 --> 28:09.650
[SPEAKER_04]: it will alleviate a lot of the other issues.

28:09.751 --> 28:11.905
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you said, the regular communication,

28:11.885 --> 28:17.170
[SPEAKER_04]: if they're being regularly heard and their needs are being addressed and questions being answered,

28:17.150 --> 28:23.160
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that a lot of the other stuff will slowly make itself not an issue anymore

28:23.140 --> 28:23.287
you

28:23.782 --> 28:24.425
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

28:24.445 --> 28:29.792
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, Scott, you're driving the reality, right?

28:29.772 --> 28:30.000
[SPEAKER_00]: you

28:30.751 --> 28:36.205
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good idea because you want to separate out the

28:36.185 --> 28:42.195
[SPEAKER_00]: Network down versus, you know, network is up and running, but this button is not doing what it's supposed to do.

28:42.175 --> 28:45.537
[SPEAKER_00]: versus I want a new button.

28:45.558 --> 28:48.034
[SPEAKER_00]: You can split them up into three categories of

28:48.014 --> 28:53.333
[SPEAKER_00]: burning building something that currently you know the plumbing is broken fix it right now

28:53.313 --> 28:57.940
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus, you know, so that is an absolutely

28:57.920 --> 29:03.525
[SPEAKER_00]: critical part of the intake when we need them to buy into that process.

29:03.505 --> 29:07.862
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that you guys are already thinking about that and put that in place.

29:08.078 --> 29:10.258
[SPEAKER_00]: So that process needs to

29:11.302 --> 29:16.114
[SPEAKER_00]: be adhered to, it needs to not jump into, hey, get Ethan on the phone.

29:16.094 --> 29:17.779
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan is not available anymore.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.118
[SPEAKER_00]: He's left the building.

29:19.098 --> 29:22.729
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be difficult, but we'll get there, I think.

29:22.709 --> 29:23.738
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joking.

29:24.222 --> 29:26.965
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just .

29:26.945 --> 29:30.407
[SPEAKER_00]: That intake process is really key.

29:30.387 --> 29:35.301
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to free up Ethan and their team to have even more

29:35.990 --> 29:40.228
[SPEAKER_00]: rational list of, hey, here's all this stuff, we priaged it,

29:40.208 --> 29:43.317
[SPEAKER_00]: this brain, you gotta do this work, right?

29:43.297 --> 29:47.130
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if Ethan left the building, where who is that?

29:47.110 --> 29:48.139
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

29:48.219 --> 29:52.193
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot of that.

29:52.173 --> 29:57.255
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I like having triage and product management

29:57.235 --> 30:01.963
[SPEAKER_04]: as these buffers between, like you said, with intake between the rest of the

30:01.943 --> 30:05.608
[SPEAKER_04]: all the clients and the engineers and the dev team.

30:05.588 --> 30:11.548
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we implement that and they're satisfied with what the deliverables are, I don't think it will

30:11.528 --> 30:14.839
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will move away from like as Ethan said

30:14.819 --> 30:17.927
[SPEAKER_04]: here, oh no Ethan, what about Si, what about Jacob, I think that

30:17.907 --> 30:21.522
[SPEAKER_04]: if they know that when they come into triage or product development,

30:21.502 --> 30:27.310
[SPEAKER_04]: they know they're cared for, and they're going to get what they need, and I think it will take care of itself.

30:27.290 --> 30:29.180
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe I'm too idealistic.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.659
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to give a small input on this topic.

30:33.803 --> 30:36.827
[SPEAKER_02]: for what I have for seven good months.

30:36.807 --> 30:40.793
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like what we are lacking is one service team.

30:40.773 --> 30:45.079
[SPEAKER_02]: because we have development team but their queries

30:45.059 --> 30:49.821
[SPEAKER_02]: if they can be addressed by a dedicated service team,

30:49.801 --> 30:55.170
[SPEAKER_02]: to answer those service calls, that would help our workflow a lot.

30:55.150 --> 31:00.165
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to take some of that building that confluence knowledge base out.

31:00.145 --> 31:04.992
[SPEAKER_07]: so that we can handle some more of those issues instead of

31:05.697 --> 31:09.835
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know there are things that come in that just need a script run.

31:09.815 --> 31:15.285
[SPEAKER_07]: If that can be taken care of in triage, that's going to help a lot.

31:15.535 --> 31:20.095
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got priorities in there that we're starting to implement now as well, but I don't feel like

31:20.075 --> 31:23.115
[SPEAKER_07]: the users really get it.

31:23.095 --> 31:27.756
[SPEAKER_07]: They just feel like, okay, if I put everything in as high priority, it'll just get done fast.

31:27.736 --> 31:33.595
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah so does that give you enough of a snapshot krishna

31:33.575 --> 31:35.211
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good.

31:35.918 --> 31:37.999
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I would want to do is to

31:37.979 --> 31:41.070
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, value of the triage process as it's done.

31:41.050 --> 31:45.137
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with Ethan on the back end side,

31:46.265 --> 31:51.718
[SPEAKER_00]: detail about the app, you know, JIRA and all of that stuff, the systems and

31:51.698 --> 31:57.642
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am getting a good flavor of where the issues with problems

31:57.622 --> 32:01.050
[SPEAKER_00]: My piece of dishes is so overloaded.

32:01.030 --> 32:02.730
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this is good.

32:02.810 --> 32:04.611
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a good discussion.

32:04.591 --> 32:10.602
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just important for us in the delivery side to have a process.

32:10.582 --> 32:13.791
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important for the clients to follow

32:14.817 --> 32:16.307
[SPEAKER_00]: It's communication, right?

32:16.368 --> 32:19.832
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's a small company,

32:19.812 --> 32:20.681
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not.

32:20.762 --> 32:23.410
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly big team here, right?

32:23.390 --> 32:29.400
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's no longer the case that you can just pick up the phone, call Ethan and say, hey, this thing is broke.

32:29.380 --> 32:33.433
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have some

32:33.413 --> 32:37.433
[SPEAKER_00]: rational processes that everybody follows and conveys.

32:37.413 --> 32:42.985
[SPEAKER_00]: if the conference, and I'm just throwing this out, before I, in accounting,

32:42.965 --> 32:48.486
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like calling Ethan, maybe I take a look at this confidence page and do a little

32:48.466 --> 32:51.895
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnostic myself and say, hey, I'm seeing

32:51.875 --> 32:56.907
[SPEAKER_00]: This error message, let me check if there's something on the Confidence page that talks about that.

32:57.275 --> 32:59.637
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe I can help, self help.

32:59.657 --> 33:01.918
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can fix my own problem.

33:01.898 --> 33:07.335
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having Ethan, instead of having to call Ethan and say,

33:07.315 --> 33:09.087
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if there's any points out ahead.

33:09.107 --> 33:11.563
[SPEAKER_00]: This has already been documented by Knowledge Base Sphere.

33:11.926 --> 33:13.073
[SPEAKER_00]: Go take a look at that.

33:13.053 --> 33:18.304
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that kind of a self-help process would be the first point.

33:18.284 --> 33:23.738
[SPEAKER_00]: for those classes of problems where network is down or

33:23.718 --> 33:25.156
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh...

33:25.878 --> 33:28.373
[SPEAKER_00]: the plumbing is broke.

33:29.218 --> 33:31.129
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an enhancement request,

33:31.109 --> 33:33.913
[SPEAKER_00]: I in the accounting team just go to

33:35.142 --> 33:39.062
[SPEAKER_00]: JIRA, and I submit an enhancement request.

33:39.122 --> 33:41.052
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the form could be made fairly simple enough for me to

33:41.538 --> 33:42.335
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand.

33:42.922 --> 33:48.645
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that work, that intake process, I'm sort of offloading it.

33:48.625 --> 33:53.320
[SPEAKER_00]: what Krishna is suggesting is sharing that responsibility with the client teams

33:53.300 --> 33:58.078
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them enough tools to a diagnose themselves,

33:58.430 --> 34:01.453
[SPEAKER_00]: B submit requests themselves.

34:01.433 --> 34:04.778
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't work, then maybe

34:04.758 --> 34:07.782
[SPEAKER_00]: Spock and the triage team might get on the phone with him.

34:07.762 --> 34:09.612
[SPEAKER_00]: But never call it Ethan.

34:09.632 --> 34:10.858
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bug Ethan.

34:10.878 --> 34:11.783
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in a sprint.

34:12.165 --> 34:13.452
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.

34:13.432 --> 34:18.463
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once the sprint starts lockdown, they might let us even no longer available.

34:18.443 --> 34:23.745
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the work has been identified for that spring, and that is all they're going to do.

34:23.725 --> 34:27.728
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe there's a very urgent request that maybe

34:27.708 --> 34:29.576
[SPEAKER_00]: changes the spring backlog.

34:29.637 --> 34:33.313
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, once the spring backlog has been defined,

34:33.800 --> 34:37.165
[SPEAKER_00]: No more, no more, no more.

34:37.185 --> 34:38.072
[SPEAKER_09]: You're getting one of them.

34:38.052 --> 34:40.765
[SPEAKER_09]: Just told him that I got fired.

34:40.966 --> 34:43.658
[SPEAKER_09]: Just told him, yeah, we don't have a finance team anymore.

34:43.638 --> 34:47.507
[SPEAKER_09]: While we go by aliases.

34:47.749 --> 34:48.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

34:48.515 --> 34:54.171
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, those are some ideas we need to explore

34:54.151 --> 34:58.947
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we give these client teams some tools that A,

34:59.635 --> 35:01.444
[SPEAKER_00]: have less than help themselves.

35:01.846 --> 35:05.798
[SPEAKER_00]: and be for burning situations, right?

35:05.778 --> 35:10.860
[SPEAKER_00]: And then B, if they want something in the future, like an enhancement request,

35:11.212 --> 35:15.771
[SPEAKER_00]: They submitted themselves and it goes to Scott and he looks at it and says,

35:16.780 --> 35:21.559
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yeah, this is a valid and that's my request.

35:21.539 --> 35:25.305
[SPEAKER_00]: engages with the submitter to say, what do you mean?

35:25.285 --> 35:27.380
[SPEAKER_00]: by what you said, maybe.

35:27.420 --> 35:31.026
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we flesh that out as a user story,

35:31.006 --> 35:36.443
[SPEAKER_00]: build a mock-up based on whatever they're looking for and then we say yep

35:36.423 --> 35:41.455
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's this set of 10 announcement requests that have come in.

35:41.435 --> 35:44.560
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to prioritize them for the next break.

35:44.928 --> 35:47.952
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of work me and you spot.

35:47.932 --> 35:51.985
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking at us both as the product management team, the product team,

35:51.965 --> 35:54.780
[SPEAKER_00]: who are going to be interfacing with the client teams.

35:55.243 --> 35:57.756
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Moeller talks to the client teams.

35:57.736 --> 35:59.207
[SPEAKER_00]: being a little extreme here.

35:59.610 --> 36:01.384
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the point is once

36:01.364 --> 36:04.388
[SPEAKER_00]: lockdown, Ethan and the team don't get interrupted.

36:04.368 --> 36:08.202
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the sprint is over, there's a small window where, yes,

36:08.182 --> 36:12.741
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan takes a phone call or two but really we need to get away from that mindset of

36:12.721 --> 36:16.290
[SPEAKER_00]: get on the phone with Ethernet team, that's not going to work, right?

36:16.310 --> 36:17.500
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to scale.

36:17.699 --> 36:22.917
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe get on the phone with Scott.

36:23.453 --> 36:26.595
[SPEAKER_00]: but it all just have the,

36:27.149 --> 36:31.489
[SPEAKER_00]: getting on the phone should only be sort of last resort but

36:31.908 --> 36:37.159
[SPEAKER_00]: network is down or something is just completely not working then yeah you call Skype because

36:37.139 --> 36:40.365
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot email or I cannot, you know,

36:40.345 --> 36:43.369
[SPEAKER_00]: I send this live, TV messages or whatever it is.

36:43.349 --> 36:47.114
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, and there is a regular cadence.

36:47.134 --> 36:49.107
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott meets with the client

36:49.087 --> 36:54.321
[SPEAKER_00]: We have folks every week, however often he doesn't, right?

36:54.301 --> 36:58.084
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when they tell them, here's all the list of stuff that

36:58.705 --> 36:59.772
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not working.

37:00.014 --> 37:02.068
[SPEAKER_00]: I want new stuff, whatever it is.

37:02.591 --> 37:04.665
[SPEAKER_00]: And every week we

37:04.645 --> 37:07.872
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the stuff that they've given us from the past week,

37:07.852 --> 37:11.061
[SPEAKER_00]: We organize it, categorize it.

37:11.041 --> 37:16.613
[SPEAKER_00]: feed into the spring backlog, and then we communicate back to the plant team and say,

37:17.251 --> 37:19.066
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we heard from you guys.

37:19.247 --> 37:21.102
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our plan to address it.

37:21.638 --> 37:26.839
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, look for this thing to come out in the next two weeks, three weeks, whatever it is, right?

37:26.819 --> 37:29.893
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the intake process.

37:29.873 --> 37:35.125
[SPEAKER_00]: to address the vocal clients who are

37:35.341 --> 37:39.968
[SPEAKER_00]: dissatisfied, but it will require change from both the

37:39.948 --> 37:44.794
[SPEAKER_00]: client site as well as for Skype.

37:45.213 --> 37:50.515
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just getting on the phone with Ethan or something is not working and team.

37:50.495 --> 37:56.100
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the thing that we need to break.

37:56.519 --> 37:59.998
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, let's step in the right direction.

38:02.054 --> 38:04.838
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this is good.

38:04.858 --> 38:06.613
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a sense of it.

38:09.277 --> 38:12.790
[SPEAKER_00]: This is supposed to be, in my mind, this is supposed to be an introduction.

38:12.770 --> 38:16.249
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a good intro.

38:16.229 --> 38:20.232
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually planning a little bit.

38:21.848 --> 38:23.826
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do is

38:24.211 --> 38:29.563
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, you'll be setting me up with the accounts or someone will be setting me up with the accounts and stuff like that.

38:29.543 --> 38:31.150
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're working on that today.

38:31.940 --> 38:32.706
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

38:33.250 --> 38:36.718
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I can look forward to, you know, I'll set up

38:36.698 --> 38:41.123
[SPEAKER_00]: one-on-one columns, Adam, Ethan, and Scott,

38:41.103 --> 38:45.780
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to pull in, but I want to stop the intake process

38:45.760 --> 38:46.909
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that working?

38:47.292 --> 38:48.381
[SPEAKER_00]: The triage process.

38:48.784 --> 38:49.893
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go to the GR.

38:49.913 --> 38:51.062
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand the development

38:51.042 --> 38:52.069
[SPEAKER_00]: process itself.

38:52.633 --> 38:56.378
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at the actual requirements, how they've been captured,

38:56.982 --> 39:02.082
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes I can say I want a button or I want

39:03.243 --> 39:09.051
[SPEAKER_00]: Something X but in the way it's been translated into requirements made

39:09.031 --> 39:14.670
[SPEAKER_00]: lead Ethan and the team to build Y and X is not Y and so I want to just

39:14.650 --> 39:16.543
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect the dots from...

39:17.671 --> 39:23.580
[SPEAKER_00]: the words of the client teams to what Ethan receives.

39:23.560 --> 39:29.200
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that again contributes to gap in developing.

39:29.180 --> 39:31.456
[SPEAKER_00]: Mission is a good thing.

39:31.698 --> 39:34.296
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of gives you an idea of that with

39:34.276 --> 39:38.920
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of our most recent ones, or most recent projects, kind of like that.

39:38.900 --> 39:41.957
[SPEAKER_09]: The Chuck Smith one, I think is a good one to show.

39:41.937 --> 39:45.771
[SPEAKER_09]: of how the process works and what we've gathered from them.

39:45.751 --> 39:50.715
[SPEAKER_09]: and we'll see if it all makes sense to you.

39:51.202 --> 39:55.542
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to first just start off with, you know, that list Adam you mentioned

39:55.522 --> 39:59.406
[SPEAKER_00]: who was in the meeting, who was in the team, what did you all...

39:59.386 --> 40:04.097
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can do that.

40:04.988 --> 40:09.126
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I will also be documenting as we go along

40:09.106 --> 40:12.147
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm hearing from you, each of you.

40:12.127 --> 40:15.555
[SPEAKER_00]: various parts, the triage process, the intake process,

40:15.839 --> 40:19.504
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that stuff, I'll be putting that stuff in the slides,

40:20.142 --> 40:21.472
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it is.

40:21.492 --> 40:24.313
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know,

40:24.884 --> 40:30.405
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine this week will be spent on meeting with each of you

40:30.942 --> 40:36.109
[SPEAKER_00]: separately just to get a sense of deep diving in each area.

40:36.089 --> 40:39.687
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll document all of them to a week and say, give me some technical.

40:39.667 --> 40:43.669
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came back and said, but here's all the problems we have.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.300
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's some possible solutions.

40:45.823 --> 40:48.259
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that you guys have already

40:48.239 --> 40:52.157
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten down this path of kriya so now we need to figure out why it is that that's not

40:52.880 --> 40:58.063
[SPEAKER_09]: taking so and that's that's in an instant stage at this point too where.

40:58.043 --> 41:02.856
[SPEAKER_09]: When we started beginning of the year, close to it.

41:02.836 --> 41:04.489
[SPEAKER_09]: In the spring, maybe?

41:04.509 --> 41:07.834
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this role itself is really two years old.

41:07.814 --> 41:10.585
[SPEAKER_07]: as of right now

41:10.784 --> 41:15.664
[SPEAKER_07]: Really just started working on the standard operating procedures, the

41:15.644 --> 41:20.399
[SPEAKER_07]: itself over the last couple of months, right?

41:20.419 --> 41:21.064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

41:22.073 --> 41:23.523
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea has been there.

41:24.328 --> 41:28.033
[SPEAKER_09]: Just getting it formalized and

41:28.013 --> 41:33.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Having it put in place to where everybody knows it, that's where we're at right now.

41:35.793 --> 41:36.885
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

41:38.099 --> 41:39.171
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also

41:39.944 --> 41:44.368
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a part of this week I want to dive into the actual

41:44.348 --> 41:48.722
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, you heard talking about the tech stack and all that, the actual,

41:49.462 --> 41:53.278
[SPEAKER_00]: frameworks and, you know, tools and how, you know,

41:53.815 --> 41:55.147
[SPEAKER_00]: databases and all that stuff.

41:55.288 --> 41:58.375
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just get a full understanding of that as well, but that's not

41:58.355 --> 42:01.868
[SPEAKER_00]: And the music priority, that's sort of what worked out.

42:02.236 --> 42:04.618
[SPEAKER_00]: The list I think my teeny pigs are just.

42:05.915 --> 42:11.166
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've met you all, the next step for me really is to

42:11.770 --> 42:16.819
[SPEAKER_00]: get the account set up, log in and then have Ethan walk me through what is

42:17.626 --> 42:21.510
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're using, the accounting folks and the modules.

42:21.895 --> 42:24.261
[SPEAKER_00]: with features and all of that.

42:25.150 --> 42:25.898
[SPEAKER_00]: And then

42:26.570 --> 42:29.442
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott, meeting with you to understand

42:30.552 --> 42:34.420
[SPEAKER_00]: triage process, how that works.

42:34.889 --> 42:38.875
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do this all and what I have a good understanding of our internal

42:40.255 --> 42:45.169
[SPEAKER_00]: People process technology stuff before I start engaging with the client itself.

42:45.824 --> 42:49.641
[SPEAKER_00]: When I engage with the client, I want to sort of, beyond just introductions,

42:49.840 --> 42:53.657
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the initial call is just in your production, but I want to also sort of

42:54.042 --> 42:59.766
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, have some slides and talks about, hey, this is the new world we're going to for intake,

42:59.746 --> 43:03.175
[SPEAKER_00]: No longer do you just call Ethan a team.

43:03.155 --> 43:07.798
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm being a little harsh, but this is what the intake process is going to look like.

43:08.268 --> 43:13.131
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe some forms for you to fill out when you have an idea of

43:13.111 --> 43:18.615
[SPEAKER_00]: the new thing that you want, or maybe this is where you go to see if the system is down,

43:18.595 --> 43:21.771
[SPEAKER_00]: or those kinds of classes of

43:22.274 --> 43:26.952
[SPEAKER_00]: Issue the things that they can tools that we can give them to help themselves.

43:27.286 --> 43:30.985
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if nothing works, then yes, contact Scott.

43:31.572 --> 43:34.377
[SPEAKER_00]: or call this number, whatever it is.

43:34.492 --> 43:40.502
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, I wanna reach that point before we engage with the clients

43:40.482 --> 43:45.784
[SPEAKER_00]: And then separately I want to talk to them as well to get their side of

43:45.764 --> 43:49.363
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it that, what is it that is not working for them?

43:50.770 --> 43:51.775
[SPEAKER_00]: And then,

43:51.755 --> 43:57.090
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now right now I'm hearing your side of what's not working.

43:57.070 --> 44:01.613
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear their cycle once working and then come across there.

44:01.593 --> 44:06.135
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can come up with a proposal for how things should change.

44:06.588 --> 44:09.932
[SPEAKER_00]: and then start living that change, as they say.

44:10.604 --> 44:12.536
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a little bit wasted right now.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.636
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's your idea on...

44:15.616 --> 44:20.817
[SPEAKER_09]: Like as far as your time goes, I don't know what your availability is, but

44:20.797 --> 44:26.082
[SPEAKER_09]: Like once we get you set up with access and everything, we can kind of walk you through that.

44:26.062 --> 44:30.618
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we just create some calls for you to discuss?

44:30.760 --> 44:30.840
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

44:30.820 --> 44:33.844
[SPEAKER_00]: But my lease, once I have the account set up,

44:33.824 --> 44:36.489
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can log in and take a look at stuff.

44:36.510 --> 44:38.468
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to meet with Ethan

44:38.448 --> 44:43.564
[SPEAKER_00]: had him walk me through, hey, this is what the accounting folks are using right now.

44:43.544 --> 44:48.053
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't know who can walk me through the JIRA.

44:48.033 --> 44:51.531
[SPEAKER_00]: Issues that are more specific more specifically.

44:51.551 --> 44:53.622
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand that

44:53.602 --> 44:56.811
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I am...

44:57.736 --> 45:02.177
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule to spend four hours a day with you guys, you know,

45:02.427 --> 45:07.273
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some flexibility in terms of when that is, so I can work based on

45:07.253 --> 45:13.129
[SPEAKER_00]: what your calendar looks like in terms of eating with each of the folks.

45:14.071 --> 45:18.647
[SPEAKER_09]: And so... Yeah, we'll get a feeling about that whenever we start.

45:18.627 --> 45:19.837
[SPEAKER_09]: getting into talking.

45:21.088 --> 45:22.782
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you in Central Town where you're at?

45:22.762 --> 45:24.623
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Mountain Tide.

45:24.643 --> 45:26.038
[SPEAKER_09]: Mountain Tide.

45:26.018 --> 45:29.768
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 8 o'clock, your time, Sunday time,

45:29.748 --> 45:33.328
[SPEAKER_00]: works for me, we can work something out.

45:33.308 --> 45:37.513
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a calendar that you all share,

45:37.493 --> 45:43.167
[SPEAKER_00]: and also block off times where I have to use and maybe stop.

45:43.687 --> 45:47.757
[SPEAKER_00]: work on that, like instead of my working hours and that kind of stuff.

45:47.737 --> 45:48.681
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

45:50.469 --> 45:53.663
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know Ethan's got his daily meeting at 8.30 our time.

45:53.643 --> 45:59.046
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we've got weekly meetings with the team leads

45:59.026 --> 46:03.197
[SPEAKER_09]: 9 o'clock on Mondays and 9 o'clock on Thursdays in the morning.

46:03.177 --> 46:08.682
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, other than that, we can pretty much work around anything.

46:09.961 --> 46:12.681
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I tend to work the mornings

46:13.960 --> 46:17.200
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to go into the building and other stuff.

46:17.220 --> 46:18.729
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's fine with us.

46:18.749 --> 46:19.212
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, perfect.

46:19.546 --> 46:22.036
[SPEAKER_09]: Cooperate.

46:22.057 --> 46:23.008
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

46:24.018 --> 46:28.746
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make the information on the accounts set up and all of that.

46:28.726 --> 46:33.321
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're gonna set me up with an internal email address.

46:33.342 --> 46:34.450
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe they are, yeah.

46:34.430 --> 46:39.327
[SPEAKER_09]: okay yeah what's that hit with an email account and like a team's account

46:39.307 --> 46:43.110
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff where you can IM if needed.

46:43.130 --> 46:45.283
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a Mac machine,

46:45.871 --> 46:46.364
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,

46:46.681 --> 46:48.531
[SPEAKER_00]: that I use, I don't know.

46:48.793 --> 46:50.100
[SPEAKER_00]: We have others with Max.

46:50.844 --> 46:51.145
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

46:51.467 --> 46:52.573
[SPEAKER_09]: Not many, but...

46:52.553 --> 46:55.577
[SPEAKER_09]: They do need to just follow that.

46:55.557 --> 47:00.235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we'll set you up with a VM to where you can remote in and do all your work from there.

47:00.215 --> 47:01.770
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, that's good.

47:01.790 --> 47:02.158
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, awesome.

47:02.425 --> 47:03.997
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I will look forward to hearing from you.

47:04.078 --> 47:07.525
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my next step will be to meet with Ethan.

47:08.045 --> 47:12.334
[SPEAKER_00]: starts I you know so I'll just work down

47:12.314 --> 47:13.563
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll work?

47:14.348 --> 47:17.127
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll get you a list of who's who.

47:17.107 --> 47:21.448
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I have a picture next to him.

47:21.469 --> 47:22.594
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get you who's who.

47:22.574 --> 47:23.823
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

47:24.367 --> 47:24.750
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

47:24.790 --> 47:25.395
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.

47:25.475 --> 47:26.120
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.

47:26.241 --> 47:27.268
[SPEAKER_00]: Really excited to

47:27.518 --> 47:30.559
[SPEAKER_00]: be working with you all, it's gonna be fun stuff.

47:30.944 --> 47:33.683
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice meeting.

47:33.985 --> 47:35.233
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to meet you.

47:35.213 --> 47:36.439
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

47:36.459 --> 47:36.701
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

47:36.721 --> 47:37.625
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk to you soon.

47:37.907 --> 47:38.389
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

47:38.570 --> 47:38.852
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

47:39.394 --> 47:40.178
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

47:40.199 --> 47:40.701
[SPEAKER_09]: See ya.

47:48.882 --> 47:52.163
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

47:52.404 --> 47:53.290
[SPEAKER_07]: Meeting's over.

47:55.598 --> 47:56.727
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm optimistic.

47:57.593 --> 47:58.561
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you say?

47:58.581 --> 47:59.790
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I'm optimistic.

47:59.871 --> 48:01.120
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

48:01.100 --> 48:02.029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

48:02.049 --> 48:04.714
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if he can help.

48:04.694 --> 48:09.760
[SPEAKER_04]: help us build that middle layer out, like to actually be that

48:09.740 --> 48:13.776
[SPEAKER_04]: customer service, product management, product analysis, triage,

48:13.756 --> 48:17.235
[SPEAKER_04]: and actually like be at the end of the day be

48:17.215 --> 48:19.110
[SPEAKER_04]: serving like the end user as well.

48:19.170 --> 48:20.863
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that we're not now, but like I said,

48:20.843 --> 48:24.424
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a big, it does create those gaps whenever

48:24.404 --> 48:27.546
[SPEAKER_04]: we do an initial and then we're not really

48:27.526 --> 48:30.180
[SPEAKER_04]: in that customer service realm anymore.

48:30.481 --> 48:33.537
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are just trying to code and develop and get it out the door.

48:33.517 --> 48:39.055
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're having to wear all the hats when you do get out the door.

48:39.035 --> 48:44.100
[SPEAKER_04]: with like what's a bug, what's a new feature, what's something we need to roll up.

48:44.080 --> 48:48.792
[SPEAKER_04]: into another iteration what's a brand new thing they want and then meanwhile you're trying to

48:48.772 --> 48:52.369
[SPEAKER_04]: code it all to figure out I think that

48:52.349 --> 48:54.022
[SPEAKER_04]: and just answer questions.

48:54.183 --> 48:56.622
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, in the past,

48:56.602 --> 48:59.625
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of like we had to be in the beginning.

48:59.605 --> 49:04.587
[SPEAKER_09]: just because there was only so many people here to do it yeah and now that we're big enough

49:04.567 --> 49:07.877
[SPEAKER_06]: and we can still grow some more.

49:07.857 --> 49:11.522
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like his initial plan is to kind of be

49:11.502 --> 49:16.028
[SPEAKER_06]: go between and then once he kind of gets a feel for what needs to happen then it can

49:16.008 --> 49:19.048
[SPEAKER_06]: start developing the treehouse system.

49:19.028 --> 49:23.723
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd be a mix of... I feel like, which I think he'll...

49:23.703 --> 49:28.110
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like what you're doing on the triage is exactly what we need.

49:28.090 --> 49:33.055
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it needs to be, you guys keep developing and then we need to sell that to the users

49:33.035 --> 49:39.045
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, I mean, I would envision everything intake wise, like he was everything coming into triage in a tree

49:39.025 --> 49:43.163
[SPEAKER_04]: you're determining where it needs to be flow out from there like it

49:43.143 --> 49:46.352
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe we end up having a support team at some point that's just

49:46.332 --> 49:51.111
[SPEAKER_04]: you just hand off to a support team that actually can answer questions, guide people through stuff.

49:51.091 --> 49:56.443
[SPEAKER_04]: to get them through using confluence on their own, you might have a,

49:56.423 --> 49:57.952
[SPEAKER_04]: something rounded to testing.

49:58.153 --> 50:02.316
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if it seems like it's an actual bug, maybe you need to triage something.

50:02.296 --> 50:06.653
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you would also have the product management that's really

50:06.633 --> 50:09.394
[SPEAKER_04]: the ultimate user interaction.

50:09.475 --> 50:11.732
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing a lot of that myself.

50:11.712 --> 50:16.643
[SPEAKER_07]: in the triaging part of this testing and reproducing things that

50:16.623 --> 50:20.963
[SPEAKER_07]: that they report and that seems to work pretty well.

50:20.943 --> 50:25.637
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming from testing, it's been pretty easy for me to do.

50:25.617 --> 50:28.742
[SPEAKER_04]: and see like every development piece we do,

50:28.722 --> 50:32.927
[SPEAKER_04]: even if it's a bug like you find going back through like that.

50:32.907 --> 50:38.445
[SPEAKER_04]: Product management piece and like the product manager or whatever we call it like analysis, whatever and

50:38.425 --> 50:43.643
[SPEAKER_04]: always that user go between they're the ones that like helping build out what the iterations are what

50:43.623 --> 50:46.731
[SPEAKER_04]: are, they're the ones doing the user communication.

50:46.711 --> 50:49.954
[SPEAKER_04]: and here's what we're delivering, here's what it's gonna be, what do you need.

50:49.934 --> 50:53.987
[SPEAKER_04]: And like even if you find a bug, kind of route back through them and say, hey,

50:53.967 --> 50:57.717
[SPEAKER_04]: Changing this is this what you're saying, but let them be that go between and

50:57.697 --> 51:02.104
[SPEAKER_04]: and kill off all the communication that comes directly to not just you but like

51:02.084 --> 51:06.019
[SPEAKER_04]: your team, Conrad's team, Andrew's team, it just, like, it all stopped.

51:05.999 --> 51:12.010
[SPEAKER_04]: It all goes through that plug, because right now we just assign it to the team leads if there's a plug, we can just assign it to him.

51:11.990 --> 51:16.785
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, weirdly we have this situation like,

51:16.765 --> 51:21.105
[SPEAKER_02]: During development phase, we have big gap between user and

51:21.085 --> 51:24.480
[SPEAKER_02]: as developers when there is an issue.

51:24.460 --> 51:29.155
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no gap at the immediate quality.

51:29.135 --> 51:35.145
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be a gap and there has to be a removal of the gap as well.

51:35.125 --> 51:41.102
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really interested to see what he thinks about the documents that have gotten so far.

51:41.082 --> 51:42.953
[SPEAKER_07]: and what his suggestions would be.

51:44.261 --> 51:46.755
[SPEAKER_07]: So all that stuff is even

51:46.735 --> 51:48.410
[SPEAKER_07]: flowcharted out in there.

51:48.612 --> 51:50.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I think he's

51:50.347 --> 51:54.484
[SPEAKER_04]: He reckoned I mean he alluded to it in the call like he's just one person that he can't

51:54.464 --> 51:58.500
[SPEAKER_04]: do that for everyone, but like getting it off the ground here.

51:58.480 --> 52:01.504
[SPEAKER_04]: would be good and that's the one thing I'd like to see

52:01.484 --> 52:05.048
[SPEAKER_04]: the board like a big picture wise if we're looking at this intake of

52:05.028 --> 52:08.676
[SPEAKER_04]: flow that we talked about and there being a product management team we have to

52:08.656 --> 52:12.928
[SPEAKER_04]: that team and that that might mean people from other teams that like.

52:12.908 --> 52:14.744
[SPEAKER_04]: really feel like they're aligned with that.

52:14.784 --> 52:16.115
[SPEAKER_04]: They would love to talk to users.

52:16.135 --> 52:17.164
[SPEAKER_04]: They would love to be that

52:17.144 --> 52:20.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Analysts go between that might mean that we build a team

52:20.333 --> 52:26.142
[SPEAKER_04]: out of our other teams, out of people that really, because I want people doing like what they love to do,

52:26.122 --> 52:28.683
[SPEAKER_04]: what they're good at doing, get people set up to win.

52:29.248 --> 52:31.204
[SPEAKER_04]: And like if there's people on our other teams

52:31.184 --> 52:34.410
[SPEAKER_04]: like to develop but they feel like this might be a niche then let's

52:34.390 --> 52:37.887
[SPEAKER_04]: let them come in and train and build that out, then we can

52:37.867 --> 52:40.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'd like to see a pipeline coming up of like

52:40.887 --> 52:42.595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I really like to have.

52:43.017 --> 52:44.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Developers are always kind of like you're doing.

52:45.228 --> 52:46.594
[SPEAKER_04]: Developers are coming up.

52:46.574 --> 52:51.184
[SPEAKER_04]: taking on roles that like fit them well and as we have other spots that fit

52:51.164 --> 52:55.943
[SPEAKER_04]: and get them in a place where they can really do well and succeed and help everyone.

52:55.923 --> 53:01.613
[SPEAKER_04]: so it might be that we have to kind of piece together the analysis team

53:01.593 --> 53:05.593
[SPEAKER_04]: from people who would want to do it, would love to do it and do it well.

53:05.754 --> 53:07.603
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we start bringing up more developers

53:07.583 --> 53:09.659
[SPEAKER_04]: to fill those gaps.

53:10.284 --> 53:12.683
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't ever want to get to a spot to where we're like,

53:12.663 --> 53:17.712
[SPEAKER_04]: Say like I mean you coming in and working development wise I know you were fantastic and testing and

53:17.692 --> 53:22.133
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ever be like, well, he'd be good in development, but we can't lose him in testing.

53:22.282 --> 53:23.712
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be that.

53:23.893 --> 53:26.672
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get people where they want to be and where they can really be.

53:26.652 --> 53:29.946
[SPEAKER_04]: be a star move, so yeah.

53:30.280 --> 53:32.166
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I mentioned that in the beginning.

53:32.226 --> 53:33.321
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, we're not...

53:34.246 --> 53:37.590
[SPEAKER_09]: What we haven't set up now with the different teams and stuff.

53:37.570 --> 53:42.147
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have to be what it is going forward.

53:42.127 --> 53:48.036
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you said, we want to think outside the box if we need to, just to make that process work the best.

53:48.016 --> 53:53.352
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no box.

53:53.332 --> 53:57.756
[SPEAKER_02]: We would need a service and information team like

53:57.736 --> 54:02.768
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the calls we get from Jayak, it's like they want

54:02.748 --> 54:08.404
[SPEAKER_02]: information from that database or something that has to be like

54:08.384 --> 54:09.855
[SPEAKER_02]: done on the database.

54:10.520 --> 54:12.555
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be better to not

54:12.535 --> 54:18.073
[SPEAKER_02]: like separate from the development team have a service information team yeah

54:18.053 --> 54:22.984
[SPEAKER_02]: that could directly address Jeffs and Jordan's goal or any other team.

54:22.964 --> 54:27.102
[SPEAKER_04]: I think having that division between like

54:27.807 --> 54:30.831
[SPEAKER_04]: who's actually doing it and delivering it.

54:30.811 --> 54:34.712
[SPEAKER_04]: and the users is like a huge because I just got an email from Joe

54:34.692 --> 54:39.100
[SPEAKER_04]: before this meeting where he wants me to do write a query yeah and he said it

54:39.080 --> 54:43.723
[SPEAKER_04]: It has payroll data, so it's like, I know you'll end up having to run it, so can you just do it?

54:43.703 --> 54:47.279
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of that, I think.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.208
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, because he knows that like,

54:49.188 --> 54:50.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan can do this.

54:50.822 --> 54:51.911
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just call Ethan.

54:51.931 --> 54:52.698
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris can do this.

54:52.758 --> 54:53.545
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just call Chris.

54:53.525 --> 54:54.470
[SPEAKER_04]: Jacob can do this.

54:54.551 --> 54:55.315
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just call Jacob.

54:55.436 --> 54:56.300
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want that.

54:56.421 --> 54:58.050
[SPEAKER_04]: I want it to go through.

54:58.030 --> 55:01.712
[SPEAKER_04]: a funnel that's a team and like whoever's talking like

55:01.692 --> 55:03.769
[SPEAKER_04]: is never the person to actually deliver.

55:03.930 --> 55:05.442
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want Jeff to know who does what.

55:05.422 --> 55:09.576
[SPEAKER_04]: I want there to be a person or a team he talks to.

55:09.556 --> 55:14.436
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's just good across the board anyway, but that's how all this ends up.

55:14.416 --> 55:17.997
[SPEAKER_04]: In reality, he could have easily sent

55:17.977 --> 55:19.977
[SPEAKER_04]: this request to a triage team.

55:20.542 --> 55:22.198
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have gone through this

55:22.178 --> 55:27.598
[SPEAKER_04]: hand it off to the developer, and even if there's not security to run it on production for the payroll stuff,

55:27.578 --> 55:29.689
[SPEAKER_04]: It could just be like what you would normally do.

55:29.709 --> 55:31.700
[SPEAKER_04]: You would just send me a script and say, can you run this?

55:31.740 --> 55:32.745
[SPEAKER_04]: I've written everything.

55:32.725 --> 55:36.263
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it doesn't have to come directly to me or directly to you.

55:37.087 --> 55:38.112
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how much

55:38.378 --> 55:44.389
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about database, writing database queries and databases in general, and we've got two

55:44.369 --> 55:46.863
[SPEAKER_07]: a fantastic job.

55:47.386 --> 55:49.941
[SPEAKER_07]: And she got more involved in it.

55:49.921 --> 55:55.932
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of those scripts that you end up writing just because you have access to it.

55:55.912 --> 55:58.935
[SPEAKER_07]: She's our database admin.

55:58.915 --> 56:00.001
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be awesome.

56:00.664 --> 56:04.082
[SPEAKER_07]: Include her as part of the teams, as one of the teams.

56:04.062 --> 56:09.735
[SPEAKER_09]: And even if we had, like in these specific situations where,

56:09.715 --> 56:13.583
[SPEAKER_09]: like Ethan or whoever's writing these don't have access on production.

56:15.031 --> 56:20.367
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't we have something, I know we've talked about doing something

56:20.347 --> 56:24.028
[SPEAKER_09]: in the schism or whatever in the pipelines to where we can throw out

56:24.008 --> 56:28.872
[SPEAKER_09]: Stuff like that where maybe all you got to do is click approve and then it runs it

56:28.852 --> 56:34.288
[SPEAKER_02]: In the banking system we used to have this

56:34.268 --> 56:37.461
[SPEAKER_02]: where whenever we have an issue on production,

56:37.441 --> 56:41.410
[SPEAKER_02]: We, as a developer of our service, we raise a ticket

56:41.390 --> 56:45.443
[SPEAKER_02]: and the ticket directly goes to the in-charge product owner.

56:45.423 --> 56:49.527
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he approves, he will approve the session.

56:49.507 --> 56:53.762
[SPEAKER_02]: for a certain time, like one hour, half an hour, whatever the time.

56:53.742 --> 56:55.440
[SPEAKER_02]: that requires the job.

56:55.965 --> 56:57.238
[SPEAKER_02]: And once that is done,

56:57.218 --> 57:02.385
[SPEAKER_02]: We will also have logs that monitor our actions and

57:02.365 --> 57:07.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever you want you can just see those logs like what this exact user has done.

57:07.112 --> 57:07.313
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah

57:07.293 --> 57:09.124
[SPEAKER_02]: From the security point of view.

57:09.144 --> 57:11.700
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that would be great to build out.

57:11.680 --> 57:17.691
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's another scalability thing that we're, what we're doing now isn't scalable, it's just what it's always been.

57:17.671 --> 57:23.395
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if this is the right place to ask or not, but I've just always been curious when you write a script like that.

57:23.375 --> 57:28.947
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you send it to somebody else to run, don't you kind of feel like you're flying blind a little bit?

57:28.927 --> 57:30.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.

57:31.727 --> 57:31.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

57:31.930 --> 57:35.967
[SPEAKER_03]: when we're dealing with the employee or payroll data,

57:35.947 --> 57:39.747
[SPEAKER_03]: tricky to know if my script is correct because

57:39.727 --> 57:43.695
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan a lot of times knows roughly what number he's looking for than what I'm looking for.

57:43.675 --> 57:49.483
[SPEAKER_03]: or especially with payroll data is like millions of dollars different because it's all scrambled, you know.

57:54.172 --> 57:57.617
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of like that idea, though, that you were talking about, to wear it.

57:57.597 --> 58:01.330
[SPEAKER_09]: you approve like a window of time and then just kind of

58:01.310 --> 58:07.101
[SPEAKER_02]: After that it just expires and again you have to price another ticket for that.

58:07.081 --> 58:12.771
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a project years ago called like data extract that never got out the door.

58:12.751 --> 58:13.900
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember that.

58:13.921 --> 58:16.703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that was the idea of it too, was that

58:16.683 --> 58:21.377
[SPEAKER_04]: like you could just connect to this, and which it's still,

58:21.357 --> 58:26.575
[SPEAKER_04]: the end goal of it is still or the the first iteration still kind of living out there but

58:26.555 --> 58:32.008
[SPEAKER_04]: the users could connect to that service from Excel and just pull

58:31.988 --> 58:37.645
[SPEAKER_04]: specific views we had written on SQL and they could just load an Excel sheet and manipulate it and then make their own.

58:37.625 --> 58:40.648
[SPEAKER_04]: export files or whatever they needed to do.

58:40.628 --> 58:45.610
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of that was that like a developer could just write a function or a view

58:45.590 --> 58:49.035
[SPEAKER_04]: let it get deployed and then the user does their own thing if they need.

58:49.015 --> 58:52.562
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I thought of one more project like

58:52.542 --> 58:55.937
[SPEAKER_02]: have a service that runs on the production side.

58:55.917 --> 58:59.956
[SPEAKER_02]: where it just tracks the user actions.

59:00.137 --> 59:01.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for example,

59:01.604 --> 59:06.889
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff has done some action, like he went to Jack Smith, he did click on this.

59:06.869 --> 59:08.761
[SPEAKER_02]: and this, this, and that.

59:08.782 --> 59:10.855
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came and frozen.

59:10.835 --> 59:15.259
[SPEAKER_02]: When he calls us, he'll be explaining the whole thing.

59:15.239 --> 59:21.250
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of him explaining those what he has done we can just go to the server log and

59:21.230 --> 59:22.279
[SPEAKER_02]: and just make those logs.

59:22.300 --> 59:25.367
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would help a little bit with communication too.

59:25.347 --> 59:28.170
[SPEAKER_05]: People are trying to explain what they've done to produce a bug.

59:28.210 --> 59:29.299
[SPEAKER_05]: They miss a couple of things.

59:29.279 --> 59:32.657
[SPEAKER_05]: and they can't replicate that bug anymore

59:32.637 --> 59:35.965
[SPEAKER_07]: In a limited sense, some of that's...

59:36.248 --> 59:40.740
[SPEAKER_07]: was done in the database where you would have changed by certain, right?

59:40.720 --> 59:45.178
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's kind of like that confirmation thing that we've been chasing.

59:45.158 --> 59:48.115
[SPEAKER_09]: what are we missing that she's been doing

59:48.230 --> 59:49.523
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't catch everything.

59:49.704 --> 59:52.047
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it just checks, okay,

59:52.027 --> 59:57.531
[SPEAKER_07]: This data cell got changed, this data row got changed by this person at this time.

59:57.511 --> 59:59.286
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't really know much fun on that.

59:59.769 --> 01:00:01.564
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is helpful.

01:00:01.544 --> 01:00:06.576
[SPEAKER_07]: You can at least see, oh, okay, well, I see when the last time the record was changed and by who.

01:00:06.556 --> 01:00:09.580
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we can go back and ask them what they were doing.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.389
[SPEAKER_07]: This way, like you're talking about, we wouldn't necessarily have to do that.

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:13.258
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a record of it.

01:00:13.238 --> 01:00:18.557
[SPEAKER_04]: Make notes of all those things, like the SQL access times.

01:00:18.537 --> 01:00:24.497
[SPEAKER_04]: the deployment approaches and the like the stack tracing and user step like logging

01:00:24.477 --> 01:00:26.594
[SPEAKER_04]: All that stuff's good, just take note of it.

01:00:27.098 --> 01:00:29.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially as we go through this with him,

01:00:29.033 --> 01:00:32.057
[SPEAKER_04]: build out what we want our intake and flow to look like.

01:00:32.037 --> 01:00:36.647
[SPEAKER_04]: if there's pieces like that that may not be directly part of the flow but we need to add in like we need to

01:00:36.627 --> 01:00:38.048
[SPEAKER_04]: note that and remember it.

01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:39.651
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of feel like that's something he'll

01:00:39.631 --> 01:00:44.325
[SPEAKER_03]: probably identify like if you're talking about with the logging and stuff, like that's somewhere where we're kind of lacking and I feel like

01:00:44.305 --> 01:00:50.316
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe that's something he'll bring up that'll help us a ton with being able to communicate with the users that we can actually see.

01:00:50.296 --> 01:00:55.227
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going wrong over the years happen and stuff walking we a lot of times like

01:00:55.207 --> 01:01:01.217
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like at least our team, our process is kind of

01:01:01.197 --> 01:01:05.250
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say haphazard, but you know, we don't have like a ton of structure with it.

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:08.946
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't have very specific requirements for how components should be.

01:01:08.926 --> 01:01:13.485
[SPEAKER_03]: you know implement and stuff so i write is a little bit differently so on this page we may have good error handling on this one

01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:16.489
[SPEAKER_03]: We may not, or we may forget to add logging here.

01:01:16.469 --> 01:01:21.079
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff and that's been that's been bittersweet over the years it's been cool because it's it's

01:01:21.059 --> 01:01:24.083
[SPEAKER_04]: It's granted a lot of flexibility for teams and developers

01:01:24.063 --> 01:01:30.073
[SPEAKER_04]: try new things so like we haven't learned hamstrung people on certain technologies but the other time other side of it

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:33.164
[SPEAKER_04]: we ended up having kind of the wild west of technology.

01:01:33.508 --> 01:01:34.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:34.154 --> 01:01:37.667
[SPEAKER_04]: It's opened up doors for like

01:01:37.647 --> 01:01:41.194
[SPEAKER_04]: learning new things that we wouldn't have learned otherwise but it's also made

01:01:41.174 --> 01:01:42.302
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of problems too.

01:01:42.746 --> 01:01:46.695
[SPEAKER_07]: So are you talking about standardizing how apps are written?

01:01:46.675 --> 01:01:49.817
[SPEAKER_07]: where everything has to be more on the structure.

01:01:49.797 --> 01:01:54.508
[SPEAKER_07]: Structured and everything has to have a tri-catch and everything has to have

01:01:54.488 --> 01:01:56.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can see it's benefiting from better coding standards.

01:01:56.705 --> 01:01:58.761
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are you talking more like minting or things like that?

01:01:58.741 --> 01:02:01.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel like having better coding standards might

01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:05.562
[SPEAKER_03]: where it doesn't really matter what language you're in, but making sure that, you know,

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:08.683
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're writing a service or whatever, you need to have like error handled

01:02:08.663 --> 01:02:11.711
[SPEAKER_03]: at each step or logging it needs to be in each thing.

01:02:11.792 --> 01:02:12.317
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:13.003
[SPEAKER_03]: I just...

01:02:12.983 --> 01:02:17.543
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah like for example logging it seems like a

01:02:17.523 --> 01:02:21.897
[SPEAKER_02]: product like we could take over and implement into the apps but

01:02:21.877 --> 01:02:24.431
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as easy as we think.

01:02:24.632 --> 01:02:27.769
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we might have to rewrite the whole app as well.

01:02:27.749 --> 01:02:31.262
[SPEAKER_02]: because the app was never written to be

01:02:31.242 --> 01:02:36.578
[SPEAKER_02]: or to include any logging system into it so yeah it's like

01:02:36.558 --> 01:02:40.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Every user control has to be really done.

01:02:40.388 --> 01:02:44.914
[SPEAKER_02]: and all these different platforms out there that don't talk to each other well.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:49.285
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which again, if you talk to someone like some developer,

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:54.246
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had to rewrite this whole app, they would not agree.

01:02:54.226 --> 01:02:57.368
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they would agree, but it's just like, yeah.

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:03.055
[SPEAKER_02]: it feels like a big workout a big project and once we

01:03:03.035 --> 01:03:05.230
[SPEAKER_02]: step into that project.

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:08.995
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if we are getting calls from Jeff and Jordan,

01:03:08.975 --> 01:03:11.373
[SPEAKER_02]: It will break the mold flow.

01:03:11.756 --> 01:03:14.496
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have somebody to fry in that for you.

01:03:14.476 --> 01:03:15.914
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.

01:03:17.378 --> 01:03:19.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Very optimistic though.

01:03:19.117 --> 01:03:20.492
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

01:03:20.512 --> 01:03:21.482
[SPEAKER_04]: Not for good talk anymore.

01:03:21.462 --> 01:03:27.473
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Zach got the user set up.

01:03:27.453 --> 01:03:33.193
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably as good to get the user's phone and whatnot from.

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:36.906
[SPEAKER_06]: You can ask about the log and everything.
