00:00:01,381 --> 00:00:02,279
Thank you.

2
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:19,120
[SPEAKER_03]: to be highly able and hidden's production potentials or something.

3
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:37,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Conrad needs to hurry back and get that clock congested again.

4
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pull off.

5
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a few minutes.

6
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:52,735
[SPEAKER_05]: We always try and set the one in church a little fast.

7
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:56,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So the pastor gets done quicker.

8
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:00,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially during football season.

9
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:06,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you referring to the clock that is inside the clock text?

10
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:08,405
[SPEAKER_02]: That is all too.

11
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:09,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

12
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:09,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

13
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:12,830
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

14
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:13,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

15
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:16,046
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, the wall clock.

16
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,895
[SPEAKER_02]: The clock text is a little bit off.

17
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:21,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a bad bit.

18
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:25,607
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big gap between five and six.

19
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:32,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should have bought a better clock.

20
00:01:32,168 --> 00:01:34,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're going for the gimmick.

21
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:36,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the word clock at the top middle.

22
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:41,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is like there's a bump between L.O.C.

23
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:45,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just get rid of this projector as we sit on the table and it just shoots up there.

24
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi folks, I'm sorry I'm a little late.

25
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,962
[SPEAKER_07]: You are not late compared to our cloud.

26
00:01:52,942 --> 00:01:56,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Just discussing that.

27
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:57,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on time.

28
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello Krishna, everyone?

29
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:03,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Krishna, folks.

30
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:05,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to meet you.

31
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:06,681
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

32
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:10,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So this meeting is basically just

33
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:16,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Introducing everybody, kind of getting our feet wet on what we're doing and what we want to do.

34
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:21,700
[SPEAKER_07]: and yeah just go from there see where it takes us

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,509
[SPEAKER_07]: So Krishna, just to give you some

36
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Introductions to us.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,746
[SPEAKER_07]: You already know Chris.

38
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:31,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Men on the yellow.

39
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:34,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Adam.

40
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:35,343
[SPEAKER_07]: You've already met me.

41
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:37,056
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't met me in person yet.

42
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:40,836
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope...

43
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:44,869
[SPEAKER_07]: lead the development team here in the CAPE office.

44
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,257
[SPEAKER_07]: and we got a few remote users also.

45
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:52,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Ethan is our

46
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:56,766
[SPEAKER_07]: leader of the finance team, which is the one that we're

47
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:59,770
[SPEAKER_07]: kinda gonna get our feet wet with you on.

48
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Ethan is leader of PSY.

49
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:10,114
[SPEAKER_07]: And here, and then we got Matt and Travis both remote.

50
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:12,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're also on E15.

51
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:16,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also in the room, I've got Scott here.

52
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:20,627
[SPEAKER_07]: leading our triage team slash

53
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:24,998
[SPEAKER_07]: IT support guy for any tickets that come in and we're

54
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:27,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of building that as we go also.

55
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:30,499
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something that we just started.

56
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Chris Kelly at the end of the table is leading our automation

57
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:38,566
[SPEAKER_07]: testing team.

58
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:39,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

59
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:41,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And then along with him we've got

60
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:42,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Mason?

61
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:44,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Mason is on his team.

62
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:49,568
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to start focusing on the finance guy's

63
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:54,563
[SPEAKER_07]: programs and then Matt Hendricks on the call also is

64
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:59,052
[SPEAKER_07]: the leader of our manual testing team.

65
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:04,857
[SPEAKER_07]: So, him and Chris work heavily together on the testing side of things.

66
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:09,058
[SPEAKER_00]: So, welcome to all these guys.

67
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:11,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to apologize in advance if I ask again.

68
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:15,049
[SPEAKER_00]: We make notes of all the names, but

69
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,599
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you guys do?

70
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:19,538
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's something written up somewhere that you have

71
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,287
[SPEAKER_00]: We can write that up for you.

72
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:25,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah we can do that.

73
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:28,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Krishna, do you want to say anything about yourself at all?

74
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:31,992
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just quickly introduce myself and my background.

75
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:37,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out my career as a software developer way back at Oracle.

76
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that was right after grad school.

77
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:45,441
[SPEAKER_00]: science masters and then I decided I was going to work at Oracle.

78
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:49,204
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great place to be and practice all the software.

79
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:53,946
[SPEAKER_00]: back then, you know, practices that had learned in grad school and all that.

80
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:57,034
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I decided I wanted to work at

81
00:04:57,301 --> 00:05:02,687
[SPEAKER_00]: small medium sized companies and I have since then worked at many different companies

82
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:08,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got an MBA and moved away from software engineering software development.

83
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,913
[SPEAKER_00]: into more the client side of the business where

84
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:18,027
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to customers, you talk to users of your software,

85
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:22,178
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what the pain points are, and then you

86
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:25,975
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would go talk to the engineering teams and say,

87
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,046
[SPEAKER_00]: the requirements.

88
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,772
[SPEAKER_00]: That's broadly speaking what I do.

89
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:34,345
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot more of that to the product function.

90
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:39,188
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that is most relevant here is

91
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:44,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Since about 2013, I have been involved in

92
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Agile teams and agile means

93
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Many different things do.

94
00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:56,569
[SPEAKER_00]: every company that tries to practice it.

95
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:59,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many variations of

96
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:05,344
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no correct agile leverage from what I have seen in my

97
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:08,362
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 years of doing this.

98
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:10,997
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really something that

99
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:15,402
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you adopt and it works for your

100
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:19,485
[SPEAKER_00]: your internally team, as well as your clients that you serve.

101
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:22,222
[SPEAKER_00]: finance and economy, one client.

102
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:25,341
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many other clients in your company.

103
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:30,387
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but the key elements of this is trying to,

104
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:33,390
[SPEAKER_00]: For all our additional conversations,

105
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,790
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had last time, it seems like there's a little frustration in the minds of

106
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,680
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting and finance in terms of what they are getting versus what they thought they asked

107
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,577
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a gap, it seems like.

108
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've...

109
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:53,539
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced prior

110
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,830
[SPEAKER_00]: teams is the product function.

111
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,943
[SPEAKER_00]: the product manager, my role is really to be the go between you guys

112
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:07,731
[SPEAKER_00]: and the clients and what that means is I am talking to these folks, the clients,

113
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:11,528
[SPEAKER_00]: on a fairly regular basis, and regular is the key thing.

114
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:14,532
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, regularly I go talk to them,

115
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:18,498
[SPEAKER_00]: get a sense of, hey, what are your pain points with what you're using right now?

116
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:19,645
[SPEAKER_00]: What's not working?

117
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:23,003
[SPEAKER_00]: what is working what do we need to change right

118
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:26,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And I translate those conversations into

119
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,887
[SPEAKER_00]: agile speak, which worked for you guys.

120
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:31,592
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know,

121
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,361
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the user personas?

122
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:34,506
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the epics?

123
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,380
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the user stories in these epics?

124
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,642
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the examples criteria?

125
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:43,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you put together a UX and a markup of what

126
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,500
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing should look like.

127
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,147
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we

128
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:51,150
[SPEAKER_00]: work together, you guys in the room and myself,

129
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:56,128
[SPEAKER_00]: and we put them back to develop what these guys want.

130
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,859
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what?

131
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,837
[SPEAKER_00]: The word regular will keep coming up.

132
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:01,883
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really key.

133
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:06,709
[SPEAKER_00]: that gap between what they think they asked for and what they got.

134
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:11,029
[SPEAKER_00]: That gap should not exist, and it really didn't.

135
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,885
[SPEAKER_00]: keep coming up from time to time because people, if you have a conversation on day one,

136
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:22,875
[SPEAKER_00]: And on day 45, you deliver something to these clients

137
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:26,554
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot of days that have passed between

138
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:29,946
[SPEAKER_00]: what they thought they wanted and what they think they're getting.

139
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,209
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gap needs to reduce.

140
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,143
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is, okay,

141
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:40,847
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do sprints, is it a two-week sprint, is it a week sprint, whatever it is,

142
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:46,669
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up with an iterative development process where

143
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:52,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you haven't completely delivered all of the bells and whistles, all the buttons in the UI,

144
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,714
[SPEAKER_00]: you at least give them

145
00:08:56,268 --> 00:09:00,017
[SPEAKER_00]: a UI that has the

146
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,291
[SPEAKER_00]: major elements in it so that they can start looking at it

147
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:07,290
[SPEAKER_00]: after the first week after the second week whatever it is and i'm talking to them

148
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:09,518
[SPEAKER_00]: every week, let's say.

149
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:15,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the best way to think of that is iterative versus incremental.

150
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:19,474
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a classic, and if you Google it, you'll find it.

151
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:24,368
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mona Lisa painting, there's two ways to develop the Mona Lisa painting.

152
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:29,397
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the iterative process where you draw an outline of the entire

153
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Mona Lisa in the painting.

154
00:09:31,815 --> 00:09:34,172
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's the first prop

155
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:36,284
[SPEAKER_00]: from the spring, first spring.

156
00:09:36,304 --> 00:09:40,146
[SPEAKER_00]: But then every subsequent spring you start to fill it out.

157
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:45,057
[SPEAKER_00]: You put more colors in paintings and color the hair.

158
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,452
[SPEAKER_00]: the face and all that stuff.

159
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,938
[SPEAKER_00]: But the client

160
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:54,912
[SPEAKER_00]: sees that initial drop from the first sprint and they're like,

161
00:09:54,892 --> 00:10:00,042
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no gap between what they thought they wanted versus what they're starting to get.

162
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:05,509
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in each subsequent spread, you iterate through and you start building out the painting.

163
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:09,103
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of it, they see what they've got.

164
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's one approach.

165
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:13,660
[SPEAKER_00]: The other approach is Iker Metal, where you tape the top left

166
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,064
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Mona Lisa painting, you fill in all the details of, you know,

167
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:21,263
[SPEAKER_00]: her face or maybe just the face, right?

168
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:22,249
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first break.

169
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:25,708
[SPEAKER_00]: but none of the other parts of the painting.

170
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:30,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you show that to the client and they're like, wait a minute, this is not what I asked for.

171
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,674
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gap starts to develop, right?

172
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:36,357
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my long-winded way of saying,

173
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:40,592
[SPEAKER_00]: My role here will be to help you guys get some kind of a process

174
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:45,874
[SPEAKER_00]: where we start to do an iterative process

175
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:51,865
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery to these clients so that there is no gap or if there is a gap it is fairly quickly

176
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:54,123
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed block.

177
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:55,493
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.

178
00:10:55,473 --> 00:11:01,433
[SPEAKER_00]: from the initial conversation that may seem like the pain point in the process but you know

179
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:06,006
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my value add here, so I'll stop talking.

180
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:11,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts or any reactions?

181
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:17,295
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds great, honestly.

182
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,969
[SPEAKER_03]: We could definitely use some more structure like that.

183
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the thing that I'm curious about most

184
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,302
[SPEAKER_03]: is seeing how this will fit into our team

185
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:33,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of the teams here deal with this but like I think for ours it's

186
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:36,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst is that we support, I guess,

187
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:40,583
[SPEAKER_03]: probably like three or four main groups of users, which I guess

188
00:11:40,563 --> 00:11:46,388
[SPEAKER_03]: about the finance side of things, but we also deal with some of the HR stuff and sales.

189
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:50,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of curious how that's gonna look with like sprints and stuff whenever we have

190
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of tiny little things to do on all these different apps and different

191
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: times versus working on one big feature or epic at a time?

192
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of curious, I guess.

193
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:02,790
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we want to start small.

194
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is if right now you're saying the finance and economy is

195
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,097
[SPEAKER_00]: that client is

196
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:15,970
[SPEAKER_00]: the most hopeful, let's say, the one that's had and that's been

197
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:19,868
[SPEAKER_00]: make the most noise, let's start with acting, right?

198
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,137
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on what their needs are or what their

199
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:29,892
[SPEAKER_00]: are and focus on trying to

200
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:32,625
[SPEAKER_00]: internally, our process

201
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:38,869
[SPEAKER_00]: setting it up so that we can reduce this gap between what they think they ask for and what they

202
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:41,410
[SPEAKER_00]: when they get it, what they think they have asked for.

203
00:12:41,632 --> 00:12:42,902
[SPEAKER_00]: That gap needs to

204
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:46,041
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and we need to get rid of that gap.

205
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:49,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we're gonna do that is, well, I'm jumping ahead.

206
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:51,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to value your process and all that stuff.

207
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:55,192
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to get that gap reduced.

208
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:56,402
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with that.

209
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:59,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you're serving more than one client.

210
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,110
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just use the word client.

211
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,243
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, user groups.

212
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we have this working

213
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:12,957
[SPEAKER_00]: prove this as a proof point, this process that we're putting in place works.

214
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:14,047
[SPEAKER_00]: this client.

215
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:17,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's then go find the next client.

216
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,610
[SPEAKER_00]: and then refine.

217
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:23,335
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting small would be the best way to do this.

218
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:28,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we'll find that we have to, each iteration, I don't know

219
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:32,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So every sprint, we have a retrospective.

220
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,923
[SPEAKER_00]: We stop and say, hey, what worked?

221
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:39,061
[SPEAKER_00]: what did not work, what needs to change, right?

222
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,328
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are we,

223
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:45,188
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three questions we ask, and so we ask those questions.

224
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:50,183
[SPEAKER_00]: of ourselves and then go around the room and just

225
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:55,228
[SPEAKER_00]: take that feedback and tweak the process and go to the next spring.

226
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,087
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to be useful.

227
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:01,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we have something working for one

228
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:04,189
[SPEAKER_00]: client, then we go off and

229
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:08,728
[SPEAKER_00]: work with the next team, next team, next team.

230
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,923
[SPEAKER_00]: roll this out.

231
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,171
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of

232
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,206
[SPEAKER_00]: of the product management function.

233
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:16,542
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned this to Christopher as well.

234
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:20,558
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one person and I have only so many hours with you guys.

235
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:25,958
[SPEAKER_00]: We may bring in more faults, but let's first prove this as a process that it works.

236
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:31,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can look at rolling this out of other teams and other clients.

237
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:33,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?

238
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

239
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:40,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to add to that something that we're keeping in mind as a

240
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:45,178
[SPEAKER_07]: an overall team, I say team,

241
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:49,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess is better used for that.

242
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,329
[SPEAKER_07]: The team structure is and has been

243
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,215
[SPEAKER_07]: the way it has been for how many years now?

244
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Four or five?

245
00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:01,446
[SPEAKER_07]: We're open-minded on if

246
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:05,327
[SPEAKER_07]: the team structure the way it is currently

247
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:09,512
[SPEAKER_07]: housed to where we have roughly four

248
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess three or four guys on each team.

249
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,790
[SPEAKER_07]: that will work on this group of applications.

250
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,802
[SPEAKER_07]: If it makes more sense to do it a different way, whether it's

251
00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:24,058
[SPEAKER_07]: just blowing it all up and not have teams and just.

252
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:29,323
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of give a project to a certain amount of people or developers or

253
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:34,015
[SPEAKER_07]: it down into smaller teams to where they're focused more on certain things.

254
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:36,793
[SPEAKER_07]: We're open to anything like that.

255
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,550
[SPEAKER_07]: So just keep that in your mind if we're

256
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,022
[SPEAKER_07]: if we get into talking about these things and you notice that

257
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:47,363
[SPEAKER_07]: like the ones that are more vocal,

258
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:53,252
[SPEAKER_07]: are always going to be the ones that get their applications worked on the most.

259
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:55,211
[SPEAKER_07]: think about it a little bit different on the team side.

260
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

261
00:15:57,755 --> 00:16:03,057
[SPEAKER_00]: the advantage of just doing this small approach is

262
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:08,406
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got an existing, the analogy I use is,

263
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:12,177
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on a cruise in the middle of the Pacific.

264
00:16:12,197 --> 00:16:13,367
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on a ship.

265
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:19,003
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're trying to change an engine part because there's something not working on this.

266
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:22,638
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ship needs to keep going.

267
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,488
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot just stop the ship

268
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:26,710
[SPEAKER_00]: replace the entire engine and then start again.

269
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:28,892
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep cruising.

270
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:35,085
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take a small part of that engine, you replace it, and then hopefully that

271
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:40,587
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfies the people on deck that were complaining about that engine park.

272
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:45,902
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have to stop everything or start plugging things willy-nilly

273
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:48,341
[SPEAKER_00]: where everybody on desktop is complaining.

274
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:50,880
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want all your client teams

275
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,466
[SPEAKER_00]: getting mad at you and let's just take a really small piece

276
00:16:56,446 --> 00:16:59,824
[SPEAKER_00]: and replace that engine in

277
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:02,039
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of your cruise, so.

278
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:04,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that makes sense.

279
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:09,595
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, thank you that you can stand back once we have

280
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:15,585
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two or three clients happy with whatever process we end up with.

281
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:20,479
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can step back and say, is there a more efficient way to deliver

282
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,204
[SPEAKER_00]: what these clients are asking for and maybe the

283
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:30,317
[SPEAKER_00]: arrange the teams or broader process but that's

284
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,528
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like small.

285
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:33,658
[SPEAKER_00]: That works.

286
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:39,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Just going through some of the lists that you sent out in the meeting invite.

287
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:45,353
[SPEAKER_07]: We are getting you an account set up and a VM to remote into to kind of look at

288
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,825
[SPEAKER_07]: everything we have, so that'll be shortcoming.

289
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:56,794
[SPEAKER_07]: The next one was walk through existing functionality and how people want to get into that.

290
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:58,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

291
00:17:59,005 --> 00:17:59,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

292
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this may have to wait for a little bit,

293
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what I'm trying to do is get my arms around all of this stuff.

294
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:07,763
[SPEAKER_00]: The people, the processes,

295
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,758
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology, what you guys have built on, all that stuff.

296
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:18,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I have the login, maybe you can, once I have the setup, maybe something.

297
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:21,752
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you could walk me through what's, you know,

298
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:26,310
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're using, the client, the accounting team?

299
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:26,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

300
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:30,021
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also want to dive into the process that

301
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:34,003
[SPEAKER_00]: your team is using, you know,

302
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:37,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, you mentioned you guys use Jira as well.

303
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:42,880
[SPEAKER_00]: if i can get my content here i would look at uh you know

304
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:49,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also have it synced up to the DevOps side where these guys mainly work out of.

305
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:55,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have a Confluence knowledge base.

306
00:18:55,128 --> 00:19:00,075
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a confluence knowledge base that's tied into that as well.

307
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:04,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And do the clients take a look at the confidence pages at all?

308
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:07,423
[SPEAKER_07]: No, those are mostly internally for now.

309
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:09,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

310
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:16,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we really have any KBs out there for that kind of stuff.

311
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:20,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, those are mostly just internal for us as developers.

312
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:25,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so in terms of community,

313
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:29,303
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe this is diving into the process now, but

314
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,741
[SPEAKER_00]: when you either you've got

315
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:37,065
[SPEAKER_00]: certain set of features that economy wants now,

316
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:42,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you talk a little bit about the process that exists now

317
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:46,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, currently, usually what we'll do is

318
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:50,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Most most of the time, you know the clients like reach out to me and

319
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,965
[SPEAKER_03]: and they'll kind of explain what they want and we'll talk through it and stuff and then I will go

320
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,560
[SPEAKER_03]: either onto JIRA, we've started using that more now,

321
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,048
[SPEAKER_03]: or sometimes directly into DevOps, but we'll create the work items there like user stories or

322
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:07,170
[SPEAKER_03]: issues, you know, depending on what it is.

323
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll communicate, like, so our team, the finance team,

324
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:17,413
[SPEAKER_03]: meet like every morning around I think 8.30 we kind of discuss like what we're working on currently and

325
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:20,738
[SPEAKER_03]: what we did the day before.

326
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:24,737
[SPEAKER_03]: that's usually when we'll kind of like figure out who's going to work on what and

327
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:28,281
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just put that into an iteration, but we don't have like a very,

328
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:31,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess structured process.

329
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:35,048
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried on our most recent project to follow something

330
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:38,305
[SPEAKER_03]: more agile, like where we did sprints, like we did like one month sprints.

331
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:42,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But typically we just kind of work on these as they come in and then we'll group.

332
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:48,548
[SPEAKER_03]: group up a couple of like issues or user stories together into one release and then push it out and

333
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:54,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually at that point we'll communicate either over teams or phone call with the users and let them know that that's out.

334
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:58,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Just diving into the actual intake itself,

335
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:03,820
[SPEAKER_00]: So the client folks know to contact you.

336
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,612
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the point of contact for things that they want.

337
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:07,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

338
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:09,848
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just call you?

339
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:11,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Not anymore.

340
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:16,105
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get away from that.

341
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:19,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Which that flow is part of like

342
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:22,821
[SPEAKER_04]: What we were reaching out to you for like look at this

343
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:25,926
[SPEAKER_04]: what Ethan described and that flow had been

344
00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:30,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, detrimental might be an overstatement, but it really impacted

345
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:33,823
[SPEAKER_04]: his personal workflow and his team's workflow.

346
00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:38,025
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been trying to move that up like what Adam has said Scott's been doing.

347
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:43,999
[SPEAKER_04]: he and his team are triaging those calls, but a lot of the

348
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:49,990
[SPEAKER_04]: migration to that hasn't been super smooth with the with the user base because they

349
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,238
[SPEAKER_04]: they have this feeling that really Ethan's the only person they can talk to and so

350
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:59,558
[SPEAKER_04]: so what's ended up happening a lot of times they'll call Scott and Scott will attempt to

351
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:03,726
[SPEAKER_04]: troubleshoot the problem and at the end of the day they'll just say we need to talk to Ethan.

352
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:07,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And just growing pains on knowledge.

353
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:11,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're working on trying to like, and Scott's been doing a great job on

354
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:15,117
[SPEAKER_04]: gathering as much information as he can to kind of

355
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:18,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess prime Ethan for what's coming.

356
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:22,407
[SPEAKER_04]: but we haven't quite made that transition yet to where

357
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:25,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan's not having to feel so much of that himself.

358
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:31,975
[SPEAKER_00]: And Scott, how often do you meet with these folks, with the client team, the accounting folks?

359
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:34,199
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean, oh, I haven't yet.

360
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,058
[SPEAKER_07]: So you haven't?

361
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:40,041
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically when they're calling is when we're meeting them.

362
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:44,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a good working relationship with most of them.

363
00:22:44,257 --> 00:22:49,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been to some of the plants and some of the teams, but not all of them.

364
00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:51,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

365
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:56,325
[SPEAKER_00]: The accounting folks specifically, how often do they...

366
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:59,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're the ones that are most vocal right now, but

367
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,444
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do they vocalize?

368
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:03,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get a sense of, you know,

369
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:06,796
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual intake process in detail.

370
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:09,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they just call you Ethan every day?

371
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like.

372
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,858
[SPEAKER_02]: how often they run into a problem.

373
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:22,161
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't usually put in tickets as soon as they run into an issue.

374
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:25,165
[SPEAKER_03]: call directly and ask to speak to me.

375
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:28,168
[SPEAKER_03]: or sometimes Psy now, but

376
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:32,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd say it depends, but anywhere from

377
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:36,673
[SPEAKER_03]: three to 20 times a week, it just really depends.

378
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:41,196
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, sometimes it'll be seven or eight times in a single day.

379
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:44,963
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won't use emails to communicate, right?

380
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:46,495
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically phone calls.

381
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:48,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's their preferred guess.

382
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:51,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we're trying to get

383
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,518
[SPEAKER_05]: them to go through me.

384
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:56,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now they call one number

385
00:23:55,992 --> 00:24:01,075
[SPEAKER_05]: and it comes to Adam or I, and we get an issue put in,

386
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:02,524
[SPEAKER_05]: if they'll explain it to us.

387
00:24:03,712 --> 00:24:06,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Many times it will be, I just need to talk to Ethan.

388
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:12,027
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been trying to keep notes on those types of things and

389
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:17,157
[SPEAKER_05]: when I can ahead of time to keep a history of what's going on.

390
00:24:17,508 --> 00:24:20,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And for minors, those calls could be anything, too.

391
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:22,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

392
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:25,341
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be like almost a network down.

393
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:29,070
[SPEAKER_04]: issue that they're experiencing that really needs to be looked at now.

394
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be something they're thinking of on the current most recent release.

395
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:34,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be

396
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:38,368
[SPEAKER_04]: little thing that's bugging them or it could just be a hypothetical like hey

397
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:40,206
[SPEAKER_04]: what if we decide to do this, is that doable?

398
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:41,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it can range.

399
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,199
[SPEAKER_04]: of any of those things.

400
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even sometimes,

401
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:49,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, hey, can you write me a query, like a SQL query that will find this information?

402
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:50,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

403
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:50,687
Yeah.

404
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one time I had a call that was like,

405
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan literally just fixed it right as I answered the call, so it was great.

406
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:03,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that is

407
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:09,115
[SPEAKER_02]: natural behavior to them i mean even for us if we have some credit card issue

408
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:10,836
[SPEAKER_02]: that charge cord

409
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:16,911
[SPEAKER_02]: by some reason we just want to get to the direct person and

410
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:21,602
[SPEAKER_02]: get it resolved instead of writing emails or chatting through a customer.

411
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:21,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

412
00:25:22,044 --> 00:25:24,356
[SPEAKER_07]: We have that avenue, that's what they want.

413
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:24,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

414
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,593
[SPEAKER_05]: They get requests through email, Teams, Slack.

415
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:31,592
[SPEAKER_05]: There are various ways this happens.

416
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,917
[SPEAKER_05]: it will bypass the initial triage intake.

417
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:38,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say that's been a hurdle for us like doing in-house

418
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:43,202
[SPEAKER_04]: any in-house IT since as long as I've been here is that

419
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:48,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime I've tried to operate or do something like an IT shop would

420
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:52,062
[SPEAKER_04]: do like a third party IT shop providing a service.

421
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:57,073
[SPEAKER_04]: where we kind of set up the contractual guidelines and we define the flow.

422
00:25:57,053 --> 00:26:00,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a struggle here because

423
00:26:00,732 --> 00:26:06,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying we're not on the same team, we are all on the same team, but there's this tendency to believe that

424
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:10,860
[SPEAKER_04]: any sort of structure or hierarchy we want to

425
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,349
[SPEAKER_04]: put in is a roadblock to us really working together.

426
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:21,053
[SPEAKER_04]: We all work for WW, so if the accounting team has a question, they should just be able to call

427
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:24,192
[SPEAKER_04]: to any developer they want because we're all working

428
00:26:24,172 --> 00:26:27,685
[SPEAKER_04]: the same team, we have a team dedicated to them.

429
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:33,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as soon as we put in any structure of like, well, you need to call this number or email this ticket in,

430
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:37,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, well, no, that's impacting my workflow,

431
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:41,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to do that because we're all on the same team here in Europe.

432
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,894
[SPEAKER_04]: You see what I mean?

433
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:45,117
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had trouble offering it.

434
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:48,559
[SPEAKER_04]: operating as a software shop and I'm not saying we should

435
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,647
[SPEAKER_04]: operate everything as if we're a third party.

436
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:54,988
[SPEAKER_04]: We've hit resistance there in the past.

437
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:58,903
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big problem because it's not

438
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:02,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it impacts the client's workflow,

439
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:08,758
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side, it is affecting Ethan and all the delivery teams.

440
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:14,175
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affecting your workflow if you are working on something and get interrupted, right?

441
00:27:14,476 --> 00:27:18,563
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an optimal situation.

442
00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:23,659
[SPEAKER_00]: probably because we may have to take this offline to bubble this up.

443
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:27,675
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a process change.

444
00:27:27,942 --> 00:27:30,966
[SPEAKER_00]: that will need to get signed up from

445
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:34,662
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I would hope that at the end of the day, I feel like if we

446
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:39,066
[SPEAKER_04]: If we do like what you described well and we build out this product

447
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:43,943
[SPEAKER_04]: product management system well yeah i think that a lot of the other

448
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:46,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, they're not hard enough.

449
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:47,512
[SPEAKER_04]: to work with.

450
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:51,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean they easily acknowledge that they want to be respectful of these guys time just as

451
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So that they're not,

452
00:27:55,313 --> 00:28:01,324
[SPEAKER_04]: problematic in that sense, but I think that that gap in expectations you were talking about

453
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:07,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like if we can close that and really do product management well and customer service well, I think that it will

454
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:09,650
[SPEAKER_04]: it will alleviate a lot of the other issues.

455
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,905
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you said, the regular communication,

456
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:17,119
[SPEAKER_04]: if they're being regularly heard and their needs are being addressed and questions being answered,

457
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:23,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that a lot of the other stuff will slowly make itself not an issue anymore

458
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,317
you

459
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:24,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

460
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:29,792
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, Scott, you're driving the free route too, right?

461
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:30,000
[SPEAKER_00]: you

462
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:36,205
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good idea because you want to separate out the

463
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:42,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Network down versus, you know, network is up and running, but this button is not doing what it's supposed to do.

464
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:45,539
[SPEAKER_00]: versus I want a new button.

465
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,017
[SPEAKER_00]: You can split them up into three categories of

466
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:53,333
[SPEAKER_00]: burning building, something that currently, the plumbing is broken, fix it right now.

467
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:56,590
[SPEAKER_00]: versus you know so you know those

468
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,686
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an absolutely critical part of the intake when we need them to

469
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,319
[SPEAKER_00]: buy into that process.

470
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,415
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that you guys are already

471
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:07,714
[SPEAKER_00]: think about that and put that in place.

472
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:10,275
[SPEAKER_00]: So that process needs to

473
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:16,114
[SPEAKER_00]: be adhered to it needs to not jump into hey get ethan on the phone that is

474
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:17,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan is not available anymore.

475
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,118
[SPEAKER_00]: He's left the building.

476
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:22,712
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be difficult, but we'll get there, I think.

477
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:23,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joking.

478
00:29:24,002 --> 00:29:26,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, yeah.

479
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:30,407
[SPEAKER_00]: That intake process is really key.

480
00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:35,318
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to free up Ethan and their team to have even more

481
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:40,228
[SPEAKER_00]: rational list of, hey, here's all the stuff we priyaged it.

482
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,333
[SPEAKER_00]: this brain, you gotta do this work, right?

483
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:47,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if Ethan left the building, who is that?

484
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

485
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:49,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

486
00:29:50,073 --> 00:29:52,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a lot of that.

487
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:58,200
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I like having triage and product management as these

488
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,191
[SPEAKER_04]: like you said, with intake between the rest of the company, all the clients and the engineers

489
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:05,446
[SPEAKER_04]: and the dev team.

490
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we implement that,

491
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And and they're satisfied with what the deliverables are.

492
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it will be.

493
00:30:12,203 --> 00:30:15,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will move away from like, is Ethan here?

494
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:15,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, Ethan.

495
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:16,516
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Cy?

496
00:30:16,536 --> 00:30:17,242
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Jacob?

497
00:30:17,322 --> 00:30:17,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that.

498
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:21,522
[SPEAKER_04]: if they know that when they come into triage or product development,

499
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:27,293
[SPEAKER_04]: they know they're cared for and they're going to get what they need, then they, I think it will take care of itself.

500
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:29,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe I'm too idealistic.

501
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:32,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to give a small input on this topic.

502
00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:36,827
[SPEAKER_02]: for what I have for seven good months.

503
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:40,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like what we are lacking is one service team.

504
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:45,079
[SPEAKER_02]: because we have development team but their queries

505
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,821
[SPEAKER_02]: if they can be addressed by a dedicated service team,

506
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:55,170
[SPEAKER_02]: to answer those service calls, that would help our workflow a lot.

507
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to take some of that building that confluence in the haunch base out.

508
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:04,907
[SPEAKER_05]: so that we can handle some more of those issues instead of

509
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know there are things that come in that just need a script run.

510
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:15,319
[SPEAKER_05]: If that can be taken care of in triage, that's going to help a lot.

511
00:31:15,535 --> 00:31:20,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got priorities in there that we're starting to implement now as well, but I don't feel like

512
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:23,115
[SPEAKER_05]: the users really get it.

513
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:27,756
[SPEAKER_05]: They just feel like, okay, if I put everything in as high priority, it'll just get done fast.

514
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:29,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

515
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:33,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that give you enough of a snapshot, Krishna, of like the workflow?

516
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:33,628
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is good.

517
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:35,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is good.

518
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:37,999
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I would want to do is to

519
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,070
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, value of the triage process as well as Scott.

520
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with Ethan on the back end side,

521
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:51,718
[SPEAKER_00]: detail about that, JIRA and all of that stuff, the systems.

522
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:57,658
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am getting a good flavor of where the issues with problems

523
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:00,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that this was just so overwhelming.

524
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:01,050
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.

525
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,731
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this is good.

526
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:04,594
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a good discussion.

527
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:10,585
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just important for us in the delivery side to have a process.

528
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:13,757
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important for the clients to follow

529
00:32:14,817 --> 00:32:16,307
[SPEAKER_00]: It's communication, right?

530
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's a small company,

531
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,661
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not.

532
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:23,410
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly big team here, right?

533
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:29,400
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's no longer the case that you can just pick up the phone, call Ethan and say, hey, this thing is broke.

534
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,433
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have some

535
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:37,433
[SPEAKER_00]: rational processes that everybody follows and conveys.

536
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:42,985
[SPEAKER_00]: if the conference, and I'm just throwing this out, before I, in accounting,

537
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:48,486
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like calling Ethan, maybe I take a look at this conference page and do a little

538
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,895
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnostic myself and say, hey, I'm seeing

539
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:56,923
[SPEAKER_00]: This error message, let me check if there's something on the Confidence page that talks about that.

540
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,629
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe I can help, self help.

541
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:01,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can fix my own problem.

542
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:07,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having to call Ethan and say,

543
00:33:07,315 --> 00:33:09,087
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if there's any points out ahead.

544
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:11,563
[SPEAKER_00]: This has already been documented in all this space here.

545
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Go take a look at that.

546
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:18,321
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that kind of a self-help process would be the first point.

547
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:23,738
[SPEAKER_00]: for those classes of problems where network is down or

548
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh...

549
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,373
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the plumbing is broke.

550
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,129
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an enhancement request, maybe

551
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I in the accounting team just go to

552
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:41,085
[SPEAKER_00]: and I submit an enhancement request, you know, maybe the form could be made fairly simple enough for me to,

553
00:33:41,538 --> 00:33:42,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand.

554
00:33:42,922 --> 00:33:48,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that work, that intake process, I'm sort of offloading it.

555
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:53,303
[SPEAKER_00]: what Krishna is suggesting is, you know, sharing that responsibility with the client teams

556
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:58,078
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them enough tools to diagnose themselves,

557
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,453
[SPEAKER_00]: B submit requests themselves.

558
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:04,761
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't work, then maybe

559
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:07,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott and the triage team might get on the phone with him.

560
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,595
[SPEAKER_00]: But never call Ethan.

561
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:10,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bug Ethan.

562
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,786
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in a sprint.

563
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:13,435
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the God.

564
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:18,463
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once the sprint starts lockdown, they might let us even roll on our available.

565
00:34:18,443 --> 00:34:23,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the work has been identified for that spring, and that is all they're going to do.

566
00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:27,728
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe there's a very urgent request that maybe

567
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:33,297
[SPEAKER_00]: changes the spring backlog, but once the spring backlog has been defined,

568
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,165
[SPEAKER_00]: No more, no more, no more.

569
00:34:37,185 --> 00:34:38,072
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting one of them.

570
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:40,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Just told him that I got fired.

571
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:44,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Just told him, yeah, we don't have a finance team anymore.

572
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:47,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Will I go by aliases?

573
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

574
00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:54,171
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, those are some ideas we need to explore,

575
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:58,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we give these client teams some tools that a

576
00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:01,444
[SPEAKER_00]: have less than help themselves.

577
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:05,798
[SPEAKER_00]: and be for burning situations, right?

578
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:10,843
[SPEAKER_00]: And then B, if they want something in the future, like an enhancement request,

579
00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:15,788
[SPEAKER_00]: They submitted themselves and it goes to Scott and he looks at it and says,

580
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,542
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yeah, this is a valid and that's my request.

581
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:25,305
[SPEAKER_00]: engages with the submitter to say, what do you mean?

582
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:27,380
[SPEAKER_00]: by what you said, maybe.

583
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,026
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we flesh that out as a user story,

584
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,765
[SPEAKER_00]: build a mock-up based on whatever they're looking for.

585
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:36,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'd say, yeah,

586
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:41,472
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this set of 10 announcement requests that have come in.

587
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:44,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to prioritize them for the next break.

588
00:35:44,928 --> 00:35:47,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of work me and you spot.

589
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:51,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at us both as the product management team, the product team,

590
00:35:51,965 --> 00:35:54,780
[SPEAKER_00]: who are going to be interfacing with the client teams.

591
00:35:55,243 --> 00:35:57,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Moller talks to the client teams.

592
00:35:57,736 --> 00:35:59,206
[SPEAKER_00]: being a little extreme here.

593
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:01,401
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, once you

594
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:04,405
[SPEAKER_00]: lockdown, Ethan and the team don't get interrupted.

595
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:08,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the sprint is over, there's a small window where, yes,

596
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:12,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan takes a phone call or two but really we need to get away from that mindset of

597
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:16,290
[SPEAKER_00]: get on the phone with Ethernet team, that's not going to work, right?

598
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,500
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to scale.

599
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:22,900
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe get on the phone with Scott.

600
00:36:23,453 --> 00:36:26,562
[SPEAKER_00]: but it all just have

601
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:31,489
[SPEAKER_00]: getting on the phone should only be sort of last resort but

602
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:37,159
[SPEAKER_00]: the network is down or something is just completely not working, then yeah, you call Scott because

603
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:40,365
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot email or I cannot, you know,

604
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:43,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I send this live, team message or whatever it is.

605
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:46,973
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, and there is a regular cadence.

606
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:49,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott meets with the client

607
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:54,304
[SPEAKER_00]: We have folks every week, or however often he doesn't, right?

608
00:36:54,284 --> 00:36:58,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when they tell them, here's all of this stuff that

609
00:36:58,655 --> 00:37:04,665
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not working i want new stuff whatever it is and every week we

610
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:07,888
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the stuff that they've given us from the past week,

611
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:11,061
[SPEAKER_00]: We organize it, categorize it.

612
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:16,596
[SPEAKER_00]: feed into the spring backlog, and then we communicate back to the plant team and say,

613
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:19,229
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we heard from you guys.

614
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:21,085
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our plan to address it.

615
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:26,822
[SPEAKER_00]: look for this thing to come out in the next two weeks, whatever it is, right?

616
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:29,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the intake process.

617
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:35,074
[SPEAKER_00]: to address the vocal clients who are

618
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,968
[SPEAKER_00]: dissatisfied, but it would require change from both the

619
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:44,794
[SPEAKER_00]: client site as well as for Skype.

620
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:50,430
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just getting on the phone a week in a manner of something is not working and team.

621
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,630
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the thing that we need to break.

622
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,117
[SPEAKER_00]: The triage thing is,

623
00:37:56,502 --> 00:37:59,982
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely the step in the right direction.

624
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,847
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this is good.

625
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a sense of it.

626
00:38:09,277 --> 00:38:12,773
[SPEAKER_00]: This is supposed to be, in my mind, this is supposed to be an introduction.

627
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:16,249
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a good intro.

628
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:20,232
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually planning a little bit.

629
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:23,826
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do is

630
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:29,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, you'll be setting me up with the accounts or someone will be setting me up with the accounts and stuff like that.

631
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:31,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're working on that today.

632
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:33,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

633
00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:36,718
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I can look forward to, you know,

634
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:41,140
[SPEAKER_00]: one-on-one calls, Adam, Ethan, Scott,

635
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,780
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to pull in, but I want to stop the intake process

636
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,929
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that working?

637
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:48,381
[SPEAKER_00]: The triage process.

638
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,893
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go to the GR.

639
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand the development

640
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:56,428
[SPEAKER_00]: process itself i want to look at the actual requirements how they've been captured

641
00:38:56,982 --> 00:39:02,082
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes I can say I want a button or I want

642
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:09,034
[SPEAKER_00]: something, an X, but in the way it's been translated into requirements made

643
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:14,670
[SPEAKER_00]: need Ethan and team to build Y and X is not Y. And so I want to just

644
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect the dots from

645
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:23,597
[SPEAKER_00]: the words of the client teams to what Ethan receives.

646
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:29,200
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that again contributes to gap in developing.

647
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,279
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll kind of give you an idea of that with

648
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:38,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of our most recent ones or most recent projects kind of like that.

649
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,940
[SPEAKER_07]: The Chuck Smith one, I think is a good one to show.

650
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,771
[SPEAKER_07]: how the process works and what we've gathered from them and

651
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:50,682
[SPEAKER_07]: and we'll see if it all makes sense to you.

652
00:39:51,202 --> 00:39:55,542
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to first just start off with that list Adam you mentioned

653
00:39:55,522 --> 00:39:59,406
[SPEAKER_00]: who was in the meeting, who was in the team, what did you all...

654
00:39:59,386 --> 00:40:04,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can do that.

655
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:09,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I will also be documenting as we go along.

656
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,163
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what i'm hearing from you each of you

657
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,555
[SPEAKER_00]: various parts, the triage process, the intake process,

658
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,470
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that stuff, I'll be putting that stuff in the slides,

659
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Word doc or whatever it is.

660
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,297
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know,

661
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:30,405
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine this week will be spent on meeting with each of you

662
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:36,109
[SPEAKER_00]: separately just to get a sense of deep diving in each area.

663
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:39,687
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll document all of them to a week and say, give me some time to,

664
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:43,669
[SPEAKER_00]: So came back and said, but here's all the problems we have.

665
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,300
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's some possible solutions.

666
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:48,158
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that you guys have already

667
00:40:48,138 --> 00:40:50,037
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten down this path of kriyat.

668
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:52,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we need to figure out why it is that that's not

669
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,063
[SPEAKER_07]: taking so and that's that's in an instant stage at this point too where.

670
00:40:58,043 --> 00:41:02,856
[SPEAKER_07]: When we started beginning of the year, close to it.

671
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,489
[SPEAKER_07]: In the spring, maybe?

672
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:07,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this role itself is really two years old.

673
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:11,918
[SPEAKER_05]: as of right now

674
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:15,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Really just started working on the standard operating procedures, the

675
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:20,379
[SPEAKER_05]: itself over the last couple of months, right?

676
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:21,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

677
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,520
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea has been there.

678
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:28,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Just getting it formalized and

679
00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:33,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Having it put in place to where everybody knows it, that's where we're at right now.

680
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:36,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

681
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also,

682
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:44,368
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point this week I want to dive into the actual

683
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:48,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, you heard talking about the tech stack and all that, the actual,

684
00:41:49,462 --> 00:41:53,363
[SPEAKER_00]: frameworks and you know, tools and how, you know,

685
00:41:53,798 --> 00:41:55,148
[SPEAKER_00]: databases and all that stuff.

686
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:57,143
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just get a full understanding of that as well.

687
00:41:57,425 --> 00:41:58,392
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not

688
00:41:58,372 --> 00:42:01,851
[SPEAKER_00]: And the music priority, that's what will work out.

689
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:04,635
[SPEAKER_00]: The list I think my teeny pigs are just...

690
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:11,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've met you all, the next step for me really is to

691
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:16,836
[SPEAKER_00]: get the account set up, log in and then have Ethan walk me through what is

692
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:21,561
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're using, the accounting folks and the modules.

693
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:24,250
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of that.

694
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:25,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And then

695
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:29,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott, meeting with you to understand

696
00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:34,352
[SPEAKER_00]: process, how that works.

697
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:38,925
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do this all and what I have a good understanding of our internal

698
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:45,152
[SPEAKER_00]: People process technology stuff before I start engaging with the client itself.

699
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:49,641
[SPEAKER_00]: When I engage with the client, I want to sort of, beyond just introductions,

700
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the initial call is just in your production, but I want to also sort of

701
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:59,800
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, have some slides and talks about, hey, this is the new world we're going to for intake.

702
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,192
[SPEAKER_00]: No longer do you just call Ethan a team.

703
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:07,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm being a little harsh, but this is what the intake process is going to look like.

704
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:13,131
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some forms for you to fill out when you have an idea of,

705
00:43:13,111 --> 00:43:18,615
[SPEAKER_00]: the new thing that you want, or maybe this is where you go to see if the system is down,

706
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:21,737
[SPEAKER_00]: or those kinds of classes of

707
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:26,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Issue the things that they can tools that we can give them to help themselves.

708
00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:30,985
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if nothing works, then yes, contact Scott.

709
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:33,805
[SPEAKER_00]: or call this number, whatever it is.

710
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:36,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's,

711
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to reach that point before we engage with the clients

712
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Then separately I want to talk to them as well to get their side of

713
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:49,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it that, what is it that is not working for them?

714
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,775
[SPEAKER_00]: And then,

715
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:57,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now right now I'm hearing your side of what's not working.

716
00:43:57,053 --> 00:44:01,630
[SPEAKER_00]: i want to hear their cycle what's not working and then come up the boss there

717
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:06,135
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can come up with a proposal for how things should change.

718
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:09,966
[SPEAKER_00]: and then start living that change, as they say.

719
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,555
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a little way so I don't.

720
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:15,653
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's your idea on...

721
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:20,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Like as far as your time goes, I don't know what your availability is, but

722
00:44:20,813 --> 00:44:26,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Like once we get you set up with access and everything we gotta walk you through that and then

723
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:30,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we just create some calls for you to discuss?

724
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:30,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

725
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,861
[SPEAKER_00]: But my lease, once I have the account set up,

726
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:36,486
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can log in and take a look at stuff.

727
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:38,485
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to meet with Eaton

728
00:44:38,465 --> 00:44:43,564
[SPEAKER_00]: had him walk me through, hey, this is what the accounting folks are using right now.

729
00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:48,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't know who can walk me through the JIRA, you know, what are the

730
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:51,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Issues that have already visited more specifically.

731
00:44:51,531 --> 00:44:53,622
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand that

732
00:44:53,602 --> 00:44:56,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I am...

733
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:01,283
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled to spend four hours a day with you guys.

734
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:04,438
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some flexibility in terms of

735
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:09,130
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can work based on what your calendar looks like

736
00:45:09,616 --> 00:45:13,146
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of eating with each of the folks.

737
00:45:14,054 --> 00:45:18,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And so... Yeah, we'll get a feeling about that whenever we start.

738
00:45:18,627 --> 00:45:19,837
[SPEAKER_07]: getting into talking.

739
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:22,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you in Central Town where you're at?

740
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Mountain Tide.

741
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Mountain Tide.

742
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:29,768
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 8 o'clock, your time, center time,

743
00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:33,328
[SPEAKER_00]: works for me, I can, you know, we can work

744
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:37,513
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a calendar that you all share,

745
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:43,150
[SPEAKER_00]: and also block off times where I have to use and maybe stop.

746
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,424
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're going with that.

747
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:47,807
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up my photos and that kind of stuff.

748
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:48,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

749
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know Ethan's got his daily meeting at 8.30 our time.

750
00:45:53,643 --> 00:45:59,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've got weekly meetings with the team leads

751
00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:03,197
[SPEAKER_07]: 9 o'clock on Mondays and 9 o'clock on Thursdays in the morning.

752
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:08,715
[SPEAKER_07]: but yeah other than that we can we can pretty much work around anything

753
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:12,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I tend to work the mornings

754
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,099
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to go into the building and other stuff.

755
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's fine with us.

756
00:46:18,749 --> 00:46:19,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, perfect.

757
00:46:19,546 --> 00:46:22,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooperate.

758
00:46:22,057 --> 00:46:23,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

759
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:28,746
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make the information on the accounts set up and all of that.

760
00:46:28,726 --> 00:46:33,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're gonna set me up with an internal email address.

761
00:46:33,342 --> 00:46:34,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they are, yeah.

762
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:39,327
[SPEAKER_07]: okay yeah what's that deal with an email account and like a team's account

763
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:43,110
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff where you can IM if needed.

764
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a Mac machine,

765
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:46,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,

766
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,551
[SPEAKER_00]: that I use, I don't know.

767
00:46:48,793 --> 00:46:50,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We have others with Max.

768
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:51,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

769
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:52,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Not many, but...

770
00:46:52,553 --> 00:46:55,577
[SPEAKER_07]: They do need to just fall back.

771
00:46:55,557 --> 00:47:00,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll set you up with a VM to where you can remote in and do all your work from there.

772
00:47:00,215 --> 00:47:01,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, that's good.

773
00:47:01,624 --> 00:47:02,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, awesome.

774
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:03,997
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I will look forward to hearing from you.

775
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:07,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my next step will be to meet with Ethan.

776
00:47:08,045 --> 00:47:12,334
[SPEAKER_00]: starts I you know so I'll just work down

777
00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:13,542
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll work?

778
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:17,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll get you a list of who's who

779
00:47:17,107 --> 00:47:21,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I have a picture next to him.

780
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get you who too.

781
00:47:22,557 --> 00:47:23,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

782
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:24,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

783
00:47:24,777 --> 00:47:25,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

784
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:26,129
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.

785
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Really excited to

786
00:47:27,518 --> 00:47:28,572
[SPEAKER_00]: be working with you all.

787
00:47:28,593 --> 00:47:30,458
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fun stuff.

788
00:47:31,012 --> 00:47:33,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice meeting with Krishnan.

789
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:35,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to meet you.

790
00:47:35,213 --> 00:47:36,439
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

791
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:36,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

792
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,604
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk to you soon.

793
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:38,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

794
00:47:39,392 --> 00:47:40,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

795
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:40,718
[SPEAKER_07]: See ya.

796
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:52,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

797
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:53,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Meeting's over.

798
00:47:55,582 --> 00:48:01,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm optimistic.

799
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

800
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if he can help.

801
00:48:04,694 --> 00:48:09,743
[SPEAKER_04]: help us build that middle layer out like to actually be that

802
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:13,759
[SPEAKER_04]: customer service, product management, product analysis, triage,

803
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:17,235
[SPEAKER_04]: and actually be, at the end of the day,

804
00:48:17,215 --> 00:48:19,108
[SPEAKER_04]: serving like the end users well.

805
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:20,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that we're not now, but like I said,

806
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a big, it does create those gaps whenever

807
00:48:24,387 --> 00:48:27,529
[SPEAKER_04]: we do an initial and then we're not really

808
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:33,469
[SPEAKER_04]: that customer service realm anymore we're just trying you or you guys are trying to code and develop and get it out the door

809
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:39,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're having to wear all the hats when you do get out the door.

810
00:48:39,035 --> 00:48:44,100
[SPEAKER_04]: with like what's a bug, what's a new feature, what's something we need to roll up.

811
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,792
[SPEAKER_04]: into another iteration what's a brand new thing they want and then meanwhile you're trying to

812
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:52,352
[SPEAKER_04]: code it all to figure out I think that

813
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,264
[SPEAKER_07]: and just answer questions and call.

814
00:48:54,284 --> 00:48:56,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, in the past, it's...

815
00:48:56,618 --> 00:48:59,642
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of like we had to be in the beginning.

816
00:48:59,622 --> 00:49:02,396
[SPEAKER_07]: just because there was only so many people here to do it.

817
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,587
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that we're big enough,

818
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,860
[SPEAKER_06]: and we can still grow some more.

819
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,556
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like his initial plan is to kind of be that

820
00:49:11,536 --> 00:49:16,028
[SPEAKER_06]: go between and then once he kind of gets a feel for what needs to happen,

821
00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:19,082
[SPEAKER_06]: start developing the treehouse just to move on.

822
00:49:19,062 --> 00:49:23,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like, which I think he'll

823
00:49:23,703 --> 00:49:28,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like what you're doing on the triage is exactly what we need.

824
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:33,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it needs to be, you guys keep developing and then we need to sell that to the users

825
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:39,045
[SPEAKER_04]: but like I mean I would envision ever like intake wise like he was everything coming into triage in a tree

826
00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:43,180
[SPEAKER_04]: you're determining where it needs to be flow out from there.

827
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,352
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe we end up having a support team at some point that's just

828
00:49:46,332 --> 00:49:51,111
[SPEAKER_04]: you just hand off to a support team that actually can answer questions, guide people through stuff.

829
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:56,443
[SPEAKER_04]: to get them through using Confluence on their own, you might have a,

830
00:49:56,423 --> 00:49:57,952
[SPEAKER_04]: something rounded to testing.

831
00:49:58,153 --> 00:50:02,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if it seems like it's an actual bug, maybe maybe you need to triage something.

832
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:06,653
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you would also have the product management that's really

833
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:09,414
[SPEAKER_04]: the ultimate user interaction.

834
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:11,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing a lot of that myself.

835
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:16,660
[SPEAKER_05]: in the triaging part of this testing and reproducing things that

836
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,963
[SPEAKER_05]: that they report and that seems to work pretty well.

837
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:25,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming from testing, it's been pretty easy for me to do.

838
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:28,742
[SPEAKER_04]: and see like every development piece we do,

839
00:50:28,722 --> 00:50:32,927
[SPEAKER_04]: even if it's a bug like you find going back through like that.

840
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:38,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Product management piece and like the product manager or whatever we call it like analysis, whatever and

841
00:50:38,425 --> 00:50:40,300
[SPEAKER_04]: is always that user go-between.

842
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,103
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the ones that like helping build out what the iterations

843
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:46,731
[SPEAKER_04]: what the releases are, they're the ones doing the user communication.

844
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:49,954
[SPEAKER_04]: and here's what we're delivering, here's what it's gonna be, what do you need.

845
00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:53,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And like even if you find a bug, kind of route back through them and say, hey,

846
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,842
[SPEAKER_04]: changing this, is this what you're saying?

847
00:50:56,185 --> 00:50:57,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them be that go-between.

848
00:50:57,697 --> 00:51:02,087
[SPEAKER_04]: and kill off all the communication that comes directly to not just you but like

849
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:06,053
[SPEAKER_04]: your team, Conrad's team, Andrew's team, it just, like, it all stops.

850
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:09,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It all goes through that plug, because right now we just assign it to the team leads.

851
00:51:09,996 --> 00:51:11,706
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a bug, we can just assign it to him.

852
00:51:11,686 --> 00:51:12,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

853
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:16,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, really we have this situation, like,

854
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:21,088
[SPEAKER_02]: During development phase, we have big gap between user and

855
00:51:21,068 --> 00:51:24,480
[SPEAKER_02]: as developers when there is an issue

856
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:29,172
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no gap at the immediate quality.

857
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:35,162
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be a gap and there has to be a removal of the gap.

858
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:41,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really interested to see what he thinks about the documents that we've got so far.

859
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,951
[SPEAKER_05]: and what his suggestions would be.

860
00:51:44,259 --> 00:51:46,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So all that stuff is even

861
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:48,430
[SPEAKER_05]: flowcharted out here, so.

862
00:51:48,612 --> 00:51:50,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I think he's,

863
00:51:50,347 --> 00:51:54,484
[SPEAKER_04]: He reckoned I mean he alluded to it in the call like he's just one person that he can't

864
00:51:54,464 --> 00:51:58,500
[SPEAKER_04]: do that for everyone, but like getting it off the ground here.

865
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,504
[SPEAKER_04]: would be good and that's the one thing I'd like to see

866
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:05,048
[SPEAKER_04]: the board like a big picture wise if we're looking at this intake of

867
00:52:05,028 --> 00:52:08,676
[SPEAKER_04]: flow that we talked about and there being a product management team we have to

868
00:52:08,656 --> 00:52:12,928
[SPEAKER_04]: that team and that that might mean people from other teams that like.

869
00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:14,744
[SPEAKER_04]: really feel like they're aligned with that.

870
00:52:14,784 --> 00:52:16,115
[SPEAKER_04]: They would love to talk to users.

871
00:52:16,135 --> 00:52:17,164
[SPEAKER_04]: They would love to be that

872
00:52:17,144 --> 00:52:20,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Analysts go between that might mean that we build a team

873
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:26,142
[SPEAKER_04]: out of our other teams, out of people that really, cause I want people doing like what they love to do.

874
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:28,683
[SPEAKER_04]: what they're good at doing, get people set up to win.

875
00:52:29,248 --> 00:52:31,204
[SPEAKER_04]: And like if there's people on our other teams

876
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:34,410
[SPEAKER_04]: like to develop but they feel like this might be a niche then let's

877
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,887
[SPEAKER_04]: let them come in and train and build that out, then we can

878
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:40,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'd like to see a pipeline coming up of like

879
00:52:40,887 --> 00:52:42,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I really like to have.

880
00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:44,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Developers are always kind of like you're doing.

881
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Developers are coming up.

882
00:52:46,574 --> 00:52:51,184
[SPEAKER_04]: taking on roles that like fit them well and as we have other spots that fit

883
00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:55,943
[SPEAKER_04]: and get them in a place where they can really do well and succeed and help everyone.

884
00:52:55,923 --> 00:53:01,613
[SPEAKER_04]: so it might be that we have to piece together the analysis team

885
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:05,593
[SPEAKER_04]: from people who would want to do it, would love to do it and do it well.

886
00:53:05,754 --> 00:53:07,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we start bringing up more developers

887
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:08,530
[SPEAKER_04]: to fill those gaps.

888
00:53:10,325 --> 00:53:12,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't ever want to get to a spot to where we're like,

889
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:17,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Say like I mean you coming in and working development wise I know you were fantastic and testing and

890
00:53:17,692 --> 00:53:22,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ever be like, well, he'd be good in development, but we can't lose him in testing.

891
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be that.

892
00:53:23,752 --> 00:53:26,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get people where they want to be and where they can really be.

893
00:53:26,652 --> 00:53:29,946
[SPEAKER_04]: be a star move, so yeah.

894
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,166
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I mentioned that in the beginning.

895
00:53:32,226 --> 00:53:33,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, we're not...

896
00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:37,590
[SPEAKER_07]: What we haven't set up now with the different teams and stuff.

897
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:42,147
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be what it is going forward.

898
00:53:42,127 --> 00:53:48,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, we want to think outside the box if we need to, just to make that process work the best.

899
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:53,352
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no box.

900
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:57,756
[SPEAKER_02]: We would need a service and information team like

901
00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:02,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the calls we get from Jayak, it's like they want

902
00:54:02,748 --> 00:54:08,404
[SPEAKER_02]: information from that database or something that has to be

903
00:54:08,384 --> 00:54:09,855
[SPEAKER_02]: done on the database.

904
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be better to not

905
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:18,073
[SPEAKER_02]: like separate from the development team have a service information team yeah

906
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:22,984
[SPEAKER_02]: that could directly address Jeffs and Jordan's goal or any other team.

907
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:27,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I think having that division between like

908
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:30,831
[SPEAKER_04]: who's actually doing it and delivering it.

909
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:34,712
[SPEAKER_04]: and the users is like a huge because I just got an email from Joe

910
00:54:34,692 --> 00:54:37,733
[SPEAKER_04]: before this meeting where he wants me to write a query

911
00:54:37,713 --> 00:54:43,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, it has payroll data, so he's like, I know you'll end up having to run it, so can you just do it?

912
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:47,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of that, I think.

913
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, he knows that like,

914
00:54:49,188 --> 00:54:50,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan can do this.

915
00:54:50,923 --> 00:54:51,911
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just call Ethan.

916
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:52,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris can do this.

917
00:54:52,758 --> 00:54:53,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just call Chris.

918
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:54,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Jacob can do this.

919
00:54:54,551 --> 00:54:55,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just call Jacob.

920
00:54:55,436 --> 00:54:56,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want that.

921
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:58,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I want it to go through.

922
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:01,712
[SPEAKER_04]: a funnel that's a team and like whoever's talking to like

923
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:03,749
[SPEAKER_04]: is never the person to actually deliver.

924
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want Jeff to know who does what.

925
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:09,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I want there to be a person or a team he talks to.

926
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:14,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's just good across the board anyway, but that's how all this ends up.

927
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:17,997
[SPEAKER_04]: In reality, he could have easily sent

928
00:55:17,977 --> 00:55:19,977
[SPEAKER_04]: this request to a triage team.

929
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:22,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have gone through this

930
00:55:22,178 --> 00:55:27,598
[SPEAKER_04]: hand it off to the developer and even if there's not security to run it on production for the payroll stuff

931
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:29,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It could just be like what you would normally do.

932
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:31,700
[SPEAKER_04]: You would just send me a script and say, can you run this?

933
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I've written everything.

934
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:33,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

935
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it doesn't have to come directly to me or directly to you.

936
00:55:37,097 --> 00:55:38,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how much...

937
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:44,406
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about database, writing database queries and databases in general, and we've got two in over there that does

938
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:49,924
[SPEAKER_05]: a fantastic job and she got more involved in it you know

939
00:55:49,904 --> 00:55:55,915
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of those scripts that you end up writing just because you have access to it.

940
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:58,918
[SPEAKER_05]: She's our database admin.

941
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,007
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be awesome.

942
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:04,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And include her as part of the teams, as one of the teams.

943
00:56:04,062 --> 00:56:09,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if we had, like in these specific situations where,

944
00:56:09,715 --> 00:56:13,583
[SPEAKER_07]: like Ethan or whoever's writing these don't have access on production.

945
00:56:15,031 --> 00:56:20,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't we have something, I know we've talked about doing something

946
00:56:20,347 --> 00:56:24,028
[SPEAKER_07]: in the schism or whatever in the pipelines to where we can throw out

947
00:56:24,008 --> 00:56:28,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff like that where maybe all you got to do is click approve and then it runs it

948
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:34,288
[SPEAKER_02]: In the banking system we used to have this

949
00:56:34,268 --> 00:56:37,461
[SPEAKER_02]: where whenever we have an issue on production,

950
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:41,410
[SPEAKER_02]: We, as a developer of our service, we raise a ticket

951
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,460
[SPEAKER_02]: and the ticket directly goes to the in charge product owner

952
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he approves, he will approve the session.

953
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:53,762
[SPEAKER_02]: for a certain time, like one hour, half an hour, whatever the time.

954
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:55,438
[SPEAKER_02]: that requires the job.

955
00:56:55,963 --> 00:56:57,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And once that is done,

956
00:56:57,235 --> 00:57:02,385
[SPEAKER_02]: We will also have logs that monitor our actions and

957
00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:07,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever you want you can just see those logs like what this exact user has done.

958
00:57:07,115 --> 00:57:07,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah

959
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:09,135
[SPEAKER_02]: from the security point of view.

960
00:57:09,155 --> 00:57:11,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that would be great to build out.

961
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that's another scalability thing that we're, what we're doing now isn't scalable, it's just what it's always been.

962
00:57:17,671 --> 00:57:23,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is the right place to ask or not, but I've just always been curious when you write a script like that.

963
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:28,980
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you send it to somebody else to run, don't you kind of feel like you're flying blind a little bit?

964
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.

965
00:57:31,213 --> 00:57:31,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

966
00:57:31,964 --> 00:57:35,950
[SPEAKER_03]: like when we're dealing with like the employee or payroll data, it's

967
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,747
[SPEAKER_03]: tricky to know if like my script is correct because

968
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:43,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan a lot of times knows roughly what number he's looking for than what I'm looking for.

969
00:57:43,675 --> 00:57:49,585
[SPEAKER_03]: or especially with payroll data is like millions of dollars different because it's all scrambled, you know.

970
00:57:54,155 --> 00:57:57,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of like that idea though, that you were talking about where it,

971
00:57:57,597 --> 00:58:01,330
[SPEAKER_07]: you approve like a window of time and then just kind of

972
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:07,101
[SPEAKER_02]: After that it just expires and again you have to price another ticket for that.

973
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:12,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a project years ago called like data extract that never got out the door.

974
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:13,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember that.

975
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:16,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that was the idea of it too, was that

976
00:58:16,683 --> 00:58:21,377
[SPEAKER_04]: like you could just connect to this, and which it's still,

977
00:58:21,357 --> 00:58:26,575
[SPEAKER_04]: the end goal of it is still or the the first iteration still kind of living out there but

978
00:58:26,555 --> 00:58:31,992
[SPEAKER_04]: the users could connect to that service from Excel and just pull like

979
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:37,645
[SPEAKER_04]: specific views we had written on SQL and they could just load an Excel sheet and manipulate it and then make their own.

980
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:40,648
[SPEAKER_04]: export files or whatever they needed to do.

981
00:58:40,628 --> 00:58:45,610
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of that was that like a developer could just write a function or a view

982
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:49,018
[SPEAKER_04]: let it get deployed and then the user does their own thing if they need

983
00:58:48,998 --> 00:58:52,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I thought of one more project like

984
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:55,937
[SPEAKER_02]: have a service that runs on the production side.

985
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:59,958
[SPEAKER_02]: where it just tracks the user actions.

986
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:01,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for example,

987
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:05,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff has done some action like he went to Jack Smith.

988
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:06,889
[SPEAKER_02]: He did click on this.

989
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:08,761
[SPEAKER_02]: and this, this, and that.

990
00:59:08,782 --> 00:59:10,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came and rose and I don't know.

991
00:59:10,835 --> 00:59:15,259
[SPEAKER_02]: When he calls us, he'll be explaining the whole thing.

992
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:21,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of him explaining those what he has done we can just go to the server log and

993
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,259
[SPEAKER_02]: and just make those logs.

994
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,367
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would help a little bit with communication too.

995
00:59:25,347 --> 00:59:28,168
[SPEAKER_06]: People are trying to explain what they've done to produce a bug.

996
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,316
[SPEAKER_06]: They miss a couple of things.

997
00:59:29,296 --> 00:59:32,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can't replicate the bug anymore.

998
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:35,948
[SPEAKER_05]: In a limited sense, some of that's...

999
00:59:36,248 --> 00:59:40,757
[SPEAKER_05]: was done in the database where you would have changed by certain

1000
00:59:40,737 --> 00:59:45,178
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's kind of like that confirmation thing we've been chasing.

1001
00:59:45,158 --> 00:59:48,182
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we missing that she's been doing?

1002
00:59:48,162 --> 00:59:49,673
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't catch everything.

1003
00:59:49,693 --> 00:59:53,380
[SPEAKER_05]: It just checks, OK, this data cell got changed.

1004
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,531
[SPEAKER_05]: the state of a row got changed by this person at this time.

1005
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,284
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't really know much fun on that.

1006
00:59:59,768 --> 01:00:01,581
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is helpful.

1007
01:00:01,561 --> 01:00:06,576
[SPEAKER_05]: You can at least see, oh, okay, well, I see when the last time the record was changed and by who.

1008
01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:09,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can go back and ask them what they were doing.

1009
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,207
[SPEAKER_05]: This way, like you're talking about, we wouldn't necessarily have to do that.

1010
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:13,258
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a record of it.

1011
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:18,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Make notes of all those things, like the SQL access times.

1012
01:00:18,537 --> 01:00:24,497
[SPEAKER_04]: the deployment approaches and the like the stack tracing and user step like logging

1013
01:00:24,477 --> 01:00:26,409
[SPEAKER_04]: All that stuff's good, just take note of it.

1014
01:00:27,094 --> 01:00:28,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially as we go through this with

1015
01:00:28,342 --> 01:00:32,057
[SPEAKER_04]: we kind of build out what we want our intake and flow to look like.

1016
01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:36,647
[SPEAKER_04]: if there's pieces like that that may not be directly part of the flow but we need to add in like we need to

1017
01:00:36,627 --> 01:00:38,210
[SPEAKER_04]: note that and remember it.

1018
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:39,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of feel like that's something he'll

1019
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:44,359
[SPEAKER_03]: probably identify like if you're talking about with the logging and stuff like that's somewhere where we're kind of lacking and I feel like

1020
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:50,350
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe that's something he'll bring up that'll help us a ton with like being able to communicate with the users if we can actually see

1021
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:53,615
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going wrong, where the errors happen and stuff.

1022
01:00:53,736 --> 01:00:55,227
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times,

1023
01:00:55,207 --> 01:01:01,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like at least our team, our process is kind of

1024
01:01:01,197 --> 01:01:05,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say haphazard, but you know, we don't have like a ton of structure with it.

1025
01:01:05,298 --> 01:01:08,929
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't have like very specific requirements for how components should be.

1026
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:11,288
[SPEAKER_03]: implement and stuff, so I write it a little bit differently.

1027
01:01:11,308 --> 01:01:13,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So on this page, we may have good error handling on this one.

1028
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:16,489
[SPEAKER_03]: We may not, or we may forget to add logging here.

1029
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:21,079
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff and that's been that's been bittersweet over the years it's been cool because it's it's

1030
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:24,083
[SPEAKER_04]: It's granted a lot of flexibility for teams and developers

1031
01:01:24,063 --> 01:01:30,073
[SPEAKER_04]: try new things so like we haven't learned hamstrung people on certain technologies but the other time other side of it

1032
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:34,191
[SPEAKER_04]: we ended up having kind of a wild west of technology approach.

1033
01:01:34,171 --> 01:01:37,667
[SPEAKER_04]: It's opened up doors for like

1034
01:01:37,647 --> 01:01:41,194
[SPEAKER_04]: learning new things that we wouldn't have learned otherwise but it's also made

1035
01:01:41,174 --> 01:01:42,726
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of problems too.

1036
01:01:42,746 --> 01:01:46,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you talking about standardizing how apps are written?

1037
01:01:46,675 --> 01:01:49,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Where everything has to be more on the structure.

1038
01:01:49,814 --> 01:01:54,492
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything has to have a tri-catch and everything has to have

1039
01:01:54,472 --> 01:01:58,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are you talking more like minting or things like that?

1040
01:01:58,741 --> 01:02:01,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel like having better coding standards might

1041
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:05,562
[SPEAKER_03]: where it doesn't really matter what language you're in, but making sure that like, you know,

1042
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:08,683
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're writing a service or whatever, you need to have like error handled

1043
01:02:08,663 --> 01:02:11,709
[SPEAKER_03]: at each step or logging it needs to be in each thing.

1044
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1045
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like for example logging it seems like a

1046
01:02:17,523 --> 01:02:21,897
[SPEAKER_02]: product like we could take over and implement into the apps but

1047
01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:24,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as easy as we think.

1048
01:02:24,632 --> 01:02:27,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we might have to rewrite the whole app as well.

1049
01:02:27,749 --> 01:02:31,262
[SPEAKER_02]: because the app was never written to be

1050
01:02:31,242 --> 01:02:36,578
[SPEAKER_02]: or to include any logging system into it so yeah it's like

1051
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:40,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Every user control has to be really good WPF and

1052
01:02:40,405 --> 01:02:44,762
[SPEAKER_02]: all these different platforms out there that don't talk to each other well.

1053
01:02:44,742 --> 01:02:49,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which again if you talk to someone, like some developer,

1054
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:54,246
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had to rewrite this whole app, they would not agree.

1055
01:02:54,226 --> 01:02:57,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they would agree, but it's just like, yeah.

1056
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:03,055
[SPEAKER_02]: it feels like a big workout a big project and once we

1057
01:03:03,035 --> 01:03:08,978
[SPEAKER_02]: uh step into that project again if we are getting calls from jeff

1058
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:11,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It will break the mold flow.

1059
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,496
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have somebody to fry in that for you.

1060
01:03:14,476 --> 01:03:15,914
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.

1061
01:03:17,395 --> 01:03:21,482
[SPEAKER_04]: very optimistic though yeah i love it

1062
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:27,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Zach got the user set up.

1063
01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:31,763
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably good to get that phone and whatnot.

1064
01:03:31,803 --> 01:03:33,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Still talks.

1065
01:03:33,325 --> 01:03:36,940
