1381	2279	Thank you.
16028	19120	to be highly able and hidden's production potentials or something.
34642	37646	Conrad needs to hurry back and get that clock congested again.
38856	40146	Yeah, pull off.
42944	44533	Just a few minutes.
49981	52735	We always try and set the one in church a little fast.
53626	56852	So the pastor gets done quicker.
58132	60075	Especially during football season.
61658	66893	Are you referring to the clock that is inside the clock text?
67413	68405	That is all too.
69073	69195	Is it?
69458	69964	Yeah.
71885	72830	It is.
73252	73553	Kind of.
73895	76046	No, I mean, the wall clock.
76066	77895	The clock text is a little bit off.
77875	81692	Just a bad bit.
83393	85607	There's a big gap between five and six.
89165	92188	Maybe we should have bought a better clock.
92168	94066	I think they're going for the gimmick.
94167	96508	Look at the word clock at the top middle.
96488	101115	Yeah, it is like there's a bump between L.O.C.
101095	105587	Yeah, just get rid of this projector as we sit on the table and it just shoots up there.
108672	110726	Hi folks, I'm sorry I'm a little late.
111049	112962	You are not late compared to our cloud.
112942	116483	Just discussing that.
116644	117670	Right on time.
117650	121197	Hello Krishna, everyone?
121177	123052	Krishna, folks.
123738	125492	Nice to meet you.
125915	126681	What?
126661	130815	So this meeting is basically just
130795	136806	Introducing everybody, kind of getting our feet wet on what we're doing and what we want to do.
136786	141700	and yeah just go from there see where it takes us
141680	146509	So Krishna, just to give you some
146489	147675	Introductions to us.
148700	149746	You already know Chris.
150811	151977	Men on the yellow.
151957	154416	I'm Adam.
154496	155343	You've already met me.
155403	157056	You haven't met me in person yet.
157036	160836	So I hope...
160816	164869	lead the development team here in the CAPE office.
164849	169257	and we got a few remote users also.
169237	172615	Ethan is our
172595	176766	leader of the finance team, which is the one that we're
176746	179770	kinda gonna get our feet wet with you on.
179750	185406	And then Ethan is leader of PSY.
185386	190114	And here, and then we got Matt and Travis both remote.
190685	192612	So they're also on E15.
193081	196864	And then also in the room, I've got Scott here.
196844	200627	leading our triage team slash
200607	204998	IT support guy for any tickets that come in and we're
204978	207134	Kind of building that as we go also.
207174	210499	That's something that we just started.
210479	216287	And then Chris Kelly at the end of the table is leading our automation
216267	218566	testing team.
218889	219534	Okay.
219554	221248	And then along with him we've got
221228	222928	Mason?
222948	224809	Mason is on his team.
224789	229568	He's going to start focusing on the finance guy's
229548	234563	programs and then Matt Hendricks on the call also is
234543	239052	the leader of our manual testing team.
239032	244857	So, him and Chris work heavily together on the testing side of things.
244837	249058	So, welcome to all these guys.
249038	251591	I have to apologize in advance if I ask again.
251611	255049	We make notes of all the names, but
255029	256599	And what do you guys do?
256619	259538	But if there's something written up somewhere that you have
259518	261287	We can write that up for you.
262272	265107	Yeah we can do that.
265559	268735	Krishna, do you want to say anything about yourself at all?
268715	271992	I'll just quickly introduce myself and my background.
271972	277780	I started out my career as a software developer way back at Oracle.
277760	281475	And then that was right after grad school.
282232	285441	science masters and then I decided I was going to work at Oracle.
285421	289204	It was a great place to be and practice all the software.
289184	293946	back then, you know, practices that had learned in grad school and all that.
294398	297034	After that, I decided I wanted to work at
297301	302687	small medium sized companies and I have since then worked at many different companies
302667	308678	I also got an MBA and moved away from software engineering software development.
308658	312913	into more the client side of the business where
312893	318027	You talk to customers, you talk to users of your software,
318293	322178	figure out what the pain points are, and then you
322158	325975	then I would go talk to the engineering teams and say,
325955	327046	the requirements.
327450	329772	That's broadly speaking what I do.
329752	334345	But there's a lot more of that to the product function.
334325	339188	The thing that is most relevant here is
339168	344520	Since about 2013, I have been involved in
344500	349515	Agile teams and agile means
349799	351221	Many different things do.
351622	356569	every company that tries to practice it.
356549	359573	And there's many variations of
359553	365344	There is no correct agile leverage from what I have seen in my
365324	368362	14 years of doing this.
368804	370997	But it's really something that
370977	375402	you know, you adopt and it works for your
375382	379485	your internally team, as well as your clients that you serve.
379465	382222	finance and economy, one client.
382242	385341	There's many other clients in your company.
385861	390387	So, but the key elements of this is trying to,
390367	393390	For all our additional conversations,
393370	398790	that we had last time, it seems like there's a little frustration in the minds of
398770	404680	accounting and finance in terms of what they are getting versus what they thought they asked
404660	407577	There's a gap, it seems like.
408543	410333	And what I've...
410313	413539	experienced prior
413519	416830	teams is the product function.
416810	421943	the product manager, my role is really to be the go between you guys
421923	427731	and the clients and what that means is I am talking to these folks, the clients,
427711	431528	on a fairly regular basis, and regular is the key thing.
431508	434532	You know, regularly I go talk to them,
434512	438498	get a sense of, hey, what are your pain points with what you're using right now?
438518	439645	What's not working?
439625	443003	what is working what do we need to change right
442983	446631	And I translate those conversations into
448147	450887	agile speak, which worked for you guys.
450927	451592	So, you know,
451572	453361	What are the user personas?
453381	454506	What are the epics?
454687	457380	What are the user stories in these epics?
457833	459642	What are the examples criteria?
460124	463843	Can you put together a UX and a markup of what
463823	465500	this thing should look like.
466369	468147	And then we
468127	471150	work together, you guys in the room and myself,
471130	476128	and we put them back to develop what these guys want.
476108	477859	And then what?
478321	480837	The word regular will keep coming up.
480857	481883	It's really key.
481863	486709	that gap between what they think they asked for and what they got.
486689	491029	That gap should not exist, and it really didn't.
491009	496885	keep coming up from time to time because people, if you have a conversation on day one,
496865	502875	And on day 45, you deliver something to these clients
502855	506554	that's a lot of days that have passed between
506534	509946	what they thought they wanted and what they think they're getting.
509926	513209	So that gap needs to reduce.
513230	515143	So what I mean by that is, okay,
515393	520847	If you do sprints, is it a two-week sprint, is it a week sprint, whatever it is,
521232	526669	coming up with an iterative development process where
526649	532660	Even if you haven't completely delivered all of the bells and whistles, all the buttons in the UI,
532640	535714	you at least give them
536268	540017	a UI that has the
539997	543291	major elements in it so that they can start looking at it
543271	547290	after the first week after the second week whatever it is and i'm talking to them
547793	549518	every week, let's say.
549835	555053	And so the best way to think of that is iterative versus incremental.
555033	559474	This is a classic, and if you Google it, you'll find it.
559454	564368	the Mona Lisa painting, there's two ways to develop the Mona Lisa painting.
564348	569397	One is the iterative process where you draw an outline of the entire
569377	571069	Mona Lisa in the painting.
571815	574172	And then that's the first prop
574152	576284	from the spring, first spring.
576304	580146	But then every subsequent spring you start to fill it out.
580126	585057	You put more colors in paintings and color the hair.
585037	586452	the face and all that stuff.
587200	588938	But the client
589357	594912	sees that initial drop from the first sprint and they're like,
594892	600042	There's no gap between what they thought they wanted versus what they're starting to get.
600022	605509	And so in each subsequent spread, you iterate through and you start building out the painting.
605489	609103	And at the end of it, they see what they've got.
609083	610555	Now, that's one approach.
610575	613660	The other approach is Iker Metal, where you tape the top left
613640	618064	of the Mona Lisa painting, you fill in all the details of, you know,
618044	621263	her face or maybe just the face, right?
621283	622249	In the first break.
622229	625708	but none of the other parts of the painting.
625688	630501	And then you show that to the client and they're like, wait a minute, this is not what I asked for.
630481	632674	So the gap starts to develop, right?
632856	636357	So that's my long-winded way of saying,
636337	640592	My role here will be to help you guys get some kind of a process
640572	645874	where we start to do an iterative process
645854	651865	delivery to these clients so that there is no gap or if there is a gap it is fairly quickly
651845	654123	fixed block.
654143	655493	That's the point.
655473	661433	from the initial conversation that may seem like the pain point in the process but you know
661413	666006	That's my value add here, so I'll stop talking.
665986	671912	Any thoughts or any reactions?
671892	677295	That sounds great, honestly.
677275	679969	We could definitely use some more structure like that.
680411	683286	I think the thing that I'm curious about most
683266	687302	is seeing how this will fit into our team
687282	693073	I think a lot of the teams here deal with this but like I think for ours it's
693053	696398	Worst is that we support, I guess,
696378	700583	probably like three or four main groups of users, which I guess
700563	706388	about the finance side of things, but we also deal with some of the HR stuff and sales.
706368	710910	I'm just kind of curious how that's gonna look with like sprints and stuff whenever we have
710890	714268	Lots of tiny little things to do on all these different apps and different
714248	717795	times versus working on one big feature or epic at a time?
717775	719568	I'm kind of curious, I guess.
720192	722790	So I think we want to start small.
723040	728190	So what I mean by that is if right now you're saying the finance and economy is
728170	730097	that client is
730634	735970	the most hopeful, let's say, the one that's had and that's been
736321	739868	make the most noise, let's start with acting, right?
740050	744137	focus on what their needs are or what their
744117	749892	are and focus on trying to
749872	752625	internally, our process
752858	758869	setting it up so that we can reduce this gap between what they think they ask for and what they
758849	761410	when they get it, what they think they have asked for.
761632	762902	That gap needs to
762882	766041	come back and we need to get rid of that gap.
766021	769486	And the way we're gonna do that is, well, I'm jumping ahead.
769506	771964	I have to value your process and all that stuff.
771944	775192	we need to get that gap reduced.
775212	776402	So let's start with that.
776382	779440	And yes, you're serving more than one client.
779541	781110	I'm going to just use the word client.
781090	783243	you know, user groups.
784310	786966	And then once we have this working
786946	792957	prove this as a proof point, this process that we're putting in place works.
792937	794047	this client.
794107	797496	Now let's then go find the next client.
797476	799610	and then refine.
799872	803335	So starting small would be the best way to do this.
803315	808414	And, you know, we'll find that we have to, each iteration, I don't know
809407	812920	So every sprint, we have a retrospective.
812900	815923	We stop and say, hey, what worked?
815903	819061	what did not work, what needs to change, right?
819081	820328	And what are we,
820865	825188	There's three questions we ask, and so we ask those questions.
825168	830183	of ourselves and then go around the room and just
830939	835228	take that feedback and tweak the process and go to the next spring.
835208	838087	that is going to be useful.
838168	841168	And so once we have something working for one
841148	844189	client, then we go off and
844169	848728	work with the next team, next team, next team.
848708	849923	roll this out.
850875	852171	In terms of
852151	854206	of the product management function.
854306	856542	I've mentioned this to Christopher as well.
856792	860558	I am one person and I have only so many hours with you guys.
860538	865958	We may bring in more faults, but let's first prove this as a process that it works.
866275	871763	Then we can look at rolling this out of other teams and other clients.
871743	873257	Does that make sense?
873539	874851	Yeah.
874831	880048	Just to add to that something that we're keeping in mind as a
880028	885178	an overall team, I say team,
885158	889600	I guess is better used for that.
889580	893329	The team structure is and has been
893309	896215	the way it has been for how many years now?
896296	897345	Four or five?
897325	901446	We're open-minded on if
901426	905327	the team structure the way it is currently
905307	909512	housed to where we have roughly four
909492	912516	I guess three or four guys on each team.
912496	915790	that will work on this group of applications.
915770	920802	If it makes more sense to do it a different way, whether it's
920782	924058	just blowing it all up and not have teams and just.
924038	929323	kind of give a project to a certain amount of people or developers or
929303	934015	it down into smaller teams to where they're focused more on certain things.
933995	936793	We're open to anything like that.
936853	939550	So just keep that in your mind if we're
939530	944022	if we get into talking about these things and you notice that
944002	947363	like the ones that are more vocal,
947343	953252	are always going to be the ones that get their applications worked on the most.
953232	955211	think about it a little bit different on the team side.
956059	957775	Absolutely.
957755	963057	the advantage of just doing this small approach is
963712	968406	you've got an existing, the analogy I use is,
968386	972177	You're on a cruise in the middle of the Pacific.
972197	973367	You're on a ship.
973347	979003	and you're trying to change an engine part because there's something not working on this.
979743	982638	But the ship needs to keep going.
982920	984488	So you cannot just stop the ship
984468	986710	replace the entire engine and then start again.
986832	988892	You have to keep cruising.
989125	995085	So you take a small part of that engine, you replace it, and then hopefully that
995065	1000587	satisfies the people on deck that were complaining about that engine park.
1000567	1005902	You don't want to have to stop everything or start plugging things willy-nilly
1005882	1008341	where everybody on desktop is complaining.
1008381	1010880	So you don't want all your client teams
1010860	1016466	getting mad at you and let's just take a really small piece
1016446	1019824	and replace that engine in
1019804	1022039	the middle of your cruise, so.
1022825	1024617	Yeah, and that makes sense.
1024597	1029595	But but yeah, thank you that you can stand back once we have
1029575	1035585	one or two or three clients happy with whatever process we end up with.
1035565	1040479	then we can step back and say, is there a more efficient way to deliver
1040459	1045204	what these clients are asking for and maybe the
1045184	1050317	arrange the teams or broader process but that's
1050550	1052528	It's just like small.
1052669	1053658	That works.
1053638	1059649	Just going through some of the lists that you sent out in the meeting invite.
1059629	1065353	We are getting you an account set up and a VM to remote into to kind of look at
1065333	1069825	everything we have, so that'll be shortcoming.
1070783	1076794	The next one was walk through existing functionality and how people want to get into that.
1076774	1078362	Go ahead.
1079005	1079105	Yeah.
1079125	1082059	I think this may have to wait for a little bit,
1082039	1085828	Basically, what I'm trying to do is get my arms around all of this stuff.
1085869	1087763	The people, the processes,
1087743	1092758	the technology, what you guys have built on, all that stuff.
1092738	1098748	Once I have the login, maybe you can, once I have the setup, maybe something.
1098728	1101752	even if you could walk me through what's, you know,
1101732	1106310	what they're using, the client, the accounting team?
1106410	1106511	Yeah.
1106491	1110021	And then I also want to dive into the process that
1110001	1114003	your team is using, you know,
1113983	1117682	Adam, you mentioned you guys use Jira as well.
1117662	1122880	if i can get my content here i would look at uh you know
1123147	1129157	And then we also have it synced up to the DevOps side where these guys mainly work out of.
1129137	1135148	And we also have a Confluence knowledge base.
1135128	1140075	We have a confluence knowledge base that's tied into that as well.
1140477	1144767	And do the clients take a look at the confidence pages at all?
1144747	1147423	No, those are mostly internally for now.
1147463	1149998	Okay.
1151378	1156073	I don't know if we really have any KBs out there for that kind of stuff.
1156053	1160359	Yeah, those are mostly just internal for us as developers.
1161824	1165017	Okay, so in terms of community,
1165705	1169303	maybe this is diving into the process now, but
1170110	1173741	when you either you've got
1173721	1177065	certain set of features that economy wants now,
1177552	1182162	Could you talk a little bit about the process that exists now
1182378	1186363	Yeah, currently, usually what we'll do is
1186343	1190970	Most most of the time, you know the clients like reach out to me and
1190950	1195965	and they'll kind of explain what they want and we'll talk through it and stuff and then I will go
1195945	1199560	either onto JIRA, we've started using that more now,
1199540	1204048	or sometimes directly into DevOps, but we'll create the work items there like user stories or
1204028	1207170	issues, you know, depending on what it is.
1207150	1211423	I'll communicate, like, so our team, the finance team,
1211403	1217413	meet like every morning around I think 8.30 we kind of discuss like what we're working on currently and
1217393	1220738	what we did the day before.
1220718	1224737	that's usually when we'll kind of like figure out who's going to work on what and
1224717	1228281	We'll just put that into an iteration, but we don't have like a very,
1228261	1231285	I guess structured process.
1231265	1235048	We tried on our most recent project to follow something
1235028	1238305	more agile, like where we did sprints, like we did like one month sprints.
1238285	1242979	But typically we just kind of work on these as they come in and then we'll group.
1242959	1248548	group up a couple of like issues or user stories together into one release and then push it out and
1248528	1254538	Usually at that point we'll communicate either over teams or phone call with the users and let them know that that's out.
1254518	1258555	Just diving into the actual intake itself,
1258855	1263820	So the client folks know to contact you.
1263800	1266612	You're the point of contact for things that they want.
1266935	1267380	Yeah.
1268002	1269848	And so they just call you?
1270092	1271025	Not anymore.
1271005	1276105	I'm trying to get away from that.
1276085	1279193	Which that flow is part of like
1279173	1282821	What we were reaching out to you for like look at this
1282801	1285926	what Ethan described and that flow had been
1285906	1290499	I mean, detrimental might be an overstatement, but it really impacted
1290479	1293823	his personal workflow and his team's workflow.
1293803	1298025	We've been trying to move that up like what Adam has said Scott's been doing.
1298005	1303999	he and his team are triaging those calls, but a lot of the
1303979	1309990	migration to that hasn't been super smooth with the with the user base because they
1309970	1315238	they have this feeling that really Ethan's the only person they can talk to and so
1315218	1319558	so what's ended up happening a lot of times they'll call Scott and Scott will attempt to
1319538	1323726	troubleshoot the problem and at the end of the day they'll just say we need to talk to Ethan.
1324043	1327827	And just growing pains on knowledge.
1327807	1331877	So we're working on trying to like, and Scott's been doing a great job on
1331857	1335117	gathering as much information as he can to kind of
1335097	1338846	I guess prime Ethan for what's coming.
1338826	1342407	but we haven't quite made that transition yet to where
1342387	1345292	Ethan's not having to feel so much of that himself.
1345964	1351975	And Scott, how often do you meet with these folks, with the client team, the accounting folks?
1351955	1354199	You mean, oh, I haven't yet.
1355290	1356058	So you haven't?
1356038	1360041	It's basically when they're calling is when we're meeting them.
1360477	1364277	I don't really have a good working relationship with most of them.
1364257	1369710	I have been to some of the plants and some of the teams, but not all of them.
1370348	1371274	Okay.
1371294	1376325	The accounting folks specifically, how often do they...
1376727	1379751	Yes, they're the ones that are most vocal right now, but
1379731	1381444	How often do they vocalize?
1381565	1383801	I'm trying to get a sense of, you know,
1383781	1386796	the actual intake process in detail.
1386816	1389690	Do they just call you Ethan every day?
1389670	1392880	I mean, it's like.
1392860	1397858	how often they run into a problem.
1397838	1402161	They don't usually put in tickets as soon as they run into an issue.
1402141	1405165	call directly and ask to speak to me.
1405145	1408168	or sometimes Psy now, but
1408148	1412472	Yeah, I'd say it depends, but anywhere from
1412452	1416673	three to 20 times a week, it just really depends.
1416653	1421196	But yeah, sometimes it'll be seven or eight times in a single day.
1421817	1424963	And they won't use emails to communicate, right?
1424983	1426495	It's basically phone calls.
1426475	1428548	Yes, that's their preferred guess.
1428568	1431507	Yes, we're trying to get
1431487	1433518	them to go through me.
1434283	1436012	Right now they call one number
1435992	1441075	and it comes to Adam or I, and we get an issue put in,
1441055	1442524	if they'll explain it to us.
1443712	1446610	Many times it will be, I just need to talk to Ethan.
1446590	1452027	So I've been trying to keep notes on those types of things and
1452007	1457157	when I can ahead of time to keep a history of what's going on.
1457508	1460748	And for minors, those calls could be anything, too.
1460788	1462337	Yeah, absolutely.
1462317	1465341	It could be like almost a network down.
1465321	1469070	issue that they're experiencing that really needs to be looked at now.
1469050	1473604	It could be something they're thinking of on the current most recent release.
1473684	1474369	It could be
1474349	1478368	little thing that's bugging them or it could just be a hypothetical like hey
1478348	1480206	what if we decide to do this, is that doable?
1480508	1481760	I mean, it can range.
1481740	1483199	of any of those things.
1483220	1484983	Or even sometimes,
1484963	1489639	Just like, hey, can you write me a query, like a SQL query that will find this information?
1489659	1490224	Sure.
1490385	1490687	Yeah.
1490667	1493860	Yeah, one time I had a call that was like,
1493840	1499766	Jordan literally just fixed it right as I answered the call, so it was great.
1499746	1503597	I mean that is
1503577	1509115	natural behavior to them i mean even for us if we have some credit card issue
1509095	1510836	that charge cord
1511744	1516911	by some reason we just want to get to the direct person and
1516891	1521602	get it resolved instead of writing emails or chatting through a customer.
1521582	1521984	Right.
1522044	1524356	We have that avenue, that's what they want.
1524779	1524879	Yeah.
1524899	1527593	They get requests through email, Teams, Slack.
1527573	1531592	There are various ways this happens.
1531572	1534917	it will bypass the initial triage intake.
1534897	1538815	I'll say that's been a hurdle for us like doing in-house
1538795	1543202	any in-house IT since as long as I've been here is that
1543975	1548855	Anytime I've tried to operate or do something like an IT shop would
1548835	1552062	do like a third party IT shop providing a service.
1552042	1557073	where we kind of set up the contractual guidelines and we define the flow.
1557053	1560752	It's been a struggle here because
1560732	1566743	I'm not saying we're not on the same team, we are all on the same team, but there's this tendency to believe that
1566723	1570860	any sort of structure or hierarchy we want to
1570840	1575349	put in is a roadblock to us really working together.
1575329	1581053	We all work for WW, so if the accounting team has a question, they should just be able to call
1581033	1584192	to any developer they want because we're all working
1584172	1587685	the same team, we have a team dedicated to them.
1587665	1593675	And so as soon as we put in any structure of like, well, you need to call this number or email this ticket in,
1593655	1597202	It's, well, no, that's impacting my workflow,
1597182	1601640	So I'm not going to do that because we're all on the same team here in Europe.
1601620	1602894	You see what I mean?
1604309	1605117	We've had trouble offering it.
1605097	1608559	operating as a software shop and I'm not saying we should
1608539	1611647	operate everything as if we're a third party.
1611627	1614988	We've hit resistance there in the past.
1615407	1618903	That is a big problem because it's not
1618883	1622515	Yes, it impacts the client's workflow,
1622950	1628758	On the flip side, it is affecting Ethan and all the delivery teams.
1628738	1634175	It's affecting your workflow if you are working on something and get interrupted, right?
1634476	1638563	It's not an optimal situation.
1638543	1643659	probably because we may have to take this offline to bubble this up.
1643639	1647675	This is a process change.
1647942	1650966	that will need to get signed up from
1650946	1654662	And that's what I would hope that at the end of the day, I feel like if we
1654642	1659066	If we do like what you described well and we build out this product
1659046	1663943	product management system well yeah i think that a lot of the other
1663923	1666947	Because, I mean, they're not hard enough.
1666927	1667512	to work with.
1667573	1671790	I mean they easily acknowledge that they want to be respectful of these guys time just as
1671770	1675333	So that they're not,
1675313	1681324	problematic in that sense, but I think that that gap in expectations you were talking about
1681304	1687315	I feel like if we can close that and really do product management well and customer service well, I think that it will
1687295	1689650	it will alleviate a lot of the other issues.
1689751	1691905	And like you said, the regular communication,
1691885	1697119	if they're being regularly heard and their needs are being addressed and questions being answered,
1697099	1703110	I think that a lot of the other stuff will slowly make itself not an issue anymore
1703090	1703317	you
1703782	1704425	Absolutely.
1704445	1709792	So this, Scott, you're driving the free route too, right?
1709772	1710000	you
1710768	1716205	That is a really good idea because you want to separate out the
1716185	1722195	Network down versus, you know, network is up and running, but this button is not doing what it's supposed to do.
1722175	1725539	versus I want a new button.
1725559	1728017	You can split them up into three categories of
1727997	1733333	burning building, something that currently, the plumbing is broken, fix it right now.
1733313	1736590	versus you know so you know those
1736570	1741686	That is an absolutely critical part of the intake when we need them to
1741666	1743319	buy into that process.
1743742	1745415	It's great that you guys are already
1745395	1747714	think about that and put that in place.
1748218	1750275	So that process needs to
1751285	1756114	be adhered to it needs to not jump into hey get ethan on the phone that is
1756094	1757779	Ethan is not available anymore.
1757880	1759118	He's left the building.
1759098	1762712	That's gonna be difficult, but we'll get there, I think.
1762692	1763720	I'm joking.
1764002	1766965	Obviously, yeah.
1766945	1770407	That intake process is really key.
1770387	1775318	you need to free up Ethan and their team to have even more
1775956	1780228	rational list of, hey, here's all the stuff we priyaged it.
1780208	1783333	this brain, you gotta do this work, right?
1783313	1787130	Well, if Ethan left the building, who is that?
1787110	1788138	Yeah.
1789529	1789912	Right?
1790073	1792210	Yeah, there's a lot of that.
1792190	1798200	That's why I like having triage and product management as these
1798180	1804191	like you said, with intake between the rest of the company, all the clients and the engineers
1804171	1805446	and the dev team.
1805870	1807853	I think if we implement that,
1807833	1810813	And and they're satisfied with what the deliverables are.
1810894	1812223	I don't think it will be.
1812203	1815045	I think it will move away from like, is Ethan here?
1815085	1815831	Oh, no, Ethan.
1815851	1816516	What about Cy?
1816536	1817242	What about Jacob?
1817322	1817927	I think that.
1817907	1821522	if they know that when they come into triage or product development,
1821502	1827293	they know they're cared for and they're going to get what they need, then they, I think it will take care of itself.
1827273	1829082	And maybe I'm too idealistic.
1829142	1832659	I would like to give a small input on this topic.
1833803	1836827	for what I have for seven good months.
1836807	1840793	I feel like what we are lacking is one service team.
1840773	1845079	because we have development team but their queries
1845059	1849821	if they can be addressed by a dedicated service team,
1849801	1855170	to answer those service calls, that would help our workflow a lot.
1855150	1860182	That's going to take some of that building that confluence in the haunch base out.
1860162	1864907	so that we can handle some more of those issues instead of
1865697	1869970	So I know there are things that come in that just need a script run.
1869950	1875319	If that can be taken care of in triage, that's going to help a lot.
1875535	1880095	And we've got priorities in there that we're starting to implement now as well, but I don't feel like
1880075	1883115	the users really get it.
1883095	1887756	They just feel like, okay, if I put everything in as high priority, it'll just get done fast.
1887736	1889204	Yeah.
1889385	1893065	Does that give you enough of a snapshot, Krishna, of like the workflow?
1893085	1893628	No, this is good.
1893608	1895240	So this is good.
1895904	1897999	I think what I would want to do is to
1897979	1901070	you know, value of the triage process as well as Scott.
1901050	1905137	And then with Ethan on the back end side,
1906282	1911718	detail about that, JIRA and all of that stuff, the systems.
1911698	1917658	But I am getting a good flavor of where the issues with problems
1917638	1920525	I appreciate that this was just so overwhelming.
1920545	1921050	So yeah.
1921030	1922731	But yeah, this is good.
1922751	1924594	I think this is a good discussion.
1924574	1930585	It's not just important for us in the delivery side to have a process.
1930565	1933757	It's very important for the clients to follow
1934817	1936307	It's communication, right?
1936368	1939832	Right now, it's a small company,
1939812	1940661	But it's not.
1940762	1943410	It's a fairly big team here, right?
1943390	1949400	and it's no longer the case that you can just pick up the phone, call Ethan and say, hey, this thing is broke.
1949380	1953433	We have to have some
1953413	1957433	rational processes that everybody follows and conveys.
1957413	1962985	if the conference, and I'm just throwing this out, before I, in accounting,
1962965	1968486	feel like calling Ethan, maybe I take a look at this conference page and do a little
1968466	1971895	diagnostic myself and say, hey, I'm seeing
1971875	1976923	This error message, let me check if there's something on the Confidence page that talks about that.
1977275	1979629	And so maybe I can help, self help.
1979649	1981902	Maybe I can fix my own problem.
1981882	1987335	Instead of having to call Ethan and say,
1987315	1989087	and see if there's any points out ahead.
1989107	1991563	This has already been documented in all this space here.
1991946	1993073	Go take a look at that.
1993053	1998321	So maybe that kind of a self-help process would be the first point.
1998301	2003738	for those classes of problems where network is down or
2003718	2005156	Uh...
2005878	2008373	you know, the plumbing is broke.
2009218	2011129	If it's an enhancement request, maybe
2011109	2013913	I in the accounting team just go to
2015142	2021085	and I submit an enhancement request, you know, maybe the form could be made fairly simple enough for me to,
2021538	2022335	Understand.
2022922	2028645	And so that work, that intake process, I'm sort of offloading it.
2028625	2033303	what Krishna is suggesting is, you know, sharing that responsibility with the client teams
2033283	2038078	giving them enough tools to diagnose themselves,
2038430	2041453	B submit requests themselves.
2041433	2044761	If that doesn't work, then maybe
2044741	2047765	Scott and the triage team might get on the phone with him.
2047745	2049595	But never call Ethan.
2049615	2050861	Don't bug Ethan.
2050882	2051786	He's in a sprint.
2052168	2053435	That's the God.
2053415	2058463	You know, once the sprint starts lockdown, they might let us even roll on our available.
2058443	2063745	Because the work has been identified for that spring, and that is all they're going to do.
2063725	2067728	maybe there's a very urgent request that maybe
2067708	2073297	changes the spring backlog, but once the spring backlog has been defined,
2073800	2077165	No more, no more, no more.
2077185	2078072	You're getting one of them.
2078052	2080766	Just told him that I got fired.
2080967	2084063	Just told him, yeah, we don't have a finance team anymore.
2084043	2087508	Will I go by aliases?
2087750	2088535	Yeah.
2088515	2094171	But you know, those are some ideas we need to explore,
2094151	2098930	Can we give these client teams some tools that a
2099635	2101444	have less than help themselves.
2101863	2105798	and be for burning situations, right?
2105778	2110843	And then B, if they want something in the future, like an enhancement request,
2111212	2115788	They submitted themselves and it goes to Scott and he looks at it and says,
2116780	2121542	you know, yeah, this is a valid and that's my request.
2121522	2125305	engages with the submitter to say, what do you mean?
2125285	2127380	by what you said, maybe.
2127420	2131026	And so we flesh that out as a user story,
2131006	2133765	build a mock-up based on whatever they're looking for.
2134429	2136443	And then we'd say, yeah,
2136423	2141472	There's this set of 10 announcement requests that have come in.
2141452	2144543	Now we've got to prioritize them for the next break.
2144928	2147952	So that's the kind of work me and you spot.
2147932	2151985	I'm looking at us both as the product management team, the product team,
2151965	2154780	who are going to be interfacing with the client teams.
2155243	2157756	Ethan Moller talks to the client teams.
2157736	2159206	being a little extreme here.
2159609	2161401	But the point is, once you
2161381	2164405	lockdown, Ethan and the team don't get interrupted.
2164385	2168202	Once the sprint is over, there's a small window where, yes,
2168182	2172741	Ethan takes a phone call or two but really we need to get away from that mindset of
2172721	2176290	get on the phone with Ethernet team, that's not going to work, right?
2176310	2177500	That's not going to scale.
2177699	2182900	And so maybe get on the phone with Scott.
2183453	2186562	but it all just have
2187149	2191489	getting on the phone should only be sort of last resort but
2191874	2197159	the network is down or something is just completely not working, then yeah, you call Scott because
2197139	2200365	I cannot email or I cannot, you know,
2200345	2203369	I send this live, team message or whatever it is.
2203349	2206973	But you know, and there is a regular cadence.
2207114	2209107	Scott meets with the client
2209087	2214304	We have folks every week, or however often he doesn't, right?
2214284	2218185	And that's when they tell them, here's all of this stuff that
2218655	2224665	it's not working i want new stuff whatever it is and every week we
2224645	2227888	look at the stuff that they've given us from the past week,
2227868	2231061	We organize it, categorize it.
2231041	2236596	feed into the spring backlog, and then we communicate back to the plant team and say,
2237251	2239229	This is what we heard from you guys.
2239249	2241085	This is our plan to address it.
2241672	2246822	look for this thing to come out in the next two weeks, whatever it is, right?
2246802	2249910	So that is the intake process.
2249890	2255074	to address the vocal clients who are
2255358	2259968	dissatisfied, but it would require change from both the
2259948	2264794	client site as well as for Skype.
2265196	2270430	But yeah, just getting on the phone a week in a manner of something is not working and team.
2270410	2274630	that's the thing that we need to break.
2274650	2276117	The triage thing is,
2276502	2279982	absolutely the step in the right direction.
2282071	2284847	But yeah, this is good.
2284867	2286597	I'm getting a sense of it.
2289277	2292773	This is supposed to be, in my mind, this is supposed to be an introduction.
2292753	2296249	You're getting a good intro.
2296229	2300232	We're actually planning a little bit.
2301848	2303826	So what I want to do is
2304211	2309547	Adam, you'll be setting me up with the accounts or someone will be setting me up with the accounts and stuff like that.
2309527	2311151	Yeah, they're working on that today.
2311923	2313233	Okay, great.
2313253	2316718	So then I can look forward to, you know,
2316698	2321140	one-on-one calls, Adam, Ethan, Scott,
2321120	2325780	that you want to pull in, but I want to stop the intake process
2325760	2326929	How's that working?
2327292	2328381	The triage process.
2328784	2329893	I want to go to the GR.
2329913	2331062	I want to understand the development
2331042	2336428	process itself i want to look at the actual requirements how they've been captured
2336982	2342082	You know, sometimes I can say I want a button or I want
2343260	2349034	something, an X, but in the way it's been translated into requirements made
2349014	2354670	need Ethan and team to build Y and X is not Y. And so I want to just
2354650	2356510	Connect the dots from
2357705	2363597	the words of the client teams to what Ethan receives.
2363577	2369200	And so that again contributes to gap in developing.
2369180	2374279	We'll kind of give you an idea of that with
2374259	2378920	Some of our most recent ones or most recent projects kind of like that.
2378900	2381940	The Chuck Smith one, I think is a good one to show.
2381920	2385771	how the process works and what we've gathered from them and
2385751	2390682	and we'll see if it all makes sense to you.
2391202	2395542	I'd like to first just start off with that list Adam you mentioned
2395522	2399406	who was in the meeting, who was in the team, what did you all...
2399386	2404080	Yeah, we can do that.
2405005	2409126	And so then I will also be documenting as we go along.
2409106	2412163	you know what i'm hearing from you each of you
2412143	2415555	various parts, the triage process, the intake process,
2415839	2419470	all of that stuff, I'll be putting that stuff in the slides,
2420159	2421552	Word doc or whatever it is.
2422480	2424297	And then, you know,
2424918	2430405	I imagine this week will be spent on meeting with each of you
2430942	2436109	separately just to get a sense of deep diving in each area.
2436089	2439687	and then I'll document all of them to a week and say, give me some time to,
2439667	2443669	So came back and said, but here's all the problems we have.
2443649	2445300	and here's some possible solutions.
2445823	2448158	It's great that you guys have already
2448138	2450037	gotten down this path of kriyat.
2450057	2452157	So now we need to figure out why it is that that's not
2452880	2458063	taking so and that's that's in an instant stage at this point too where.
2458043	2462856	When we started beginning of the year, close to it.
2462836	2464489	In the spring, maybe?
2464509	2467834	Well, this role itself is really two years old.
2467814	2471918	as of right now
2472134	2475664	Really just started working on the standard operating procedures, the
2475644	2480379	itself over the last couple of months, right?
2480399	2481064	Yeah.
2482090	2483520	The idea has been there.
2484326	2488033	Just getting it formalized and
2488013	2493518	Having it put in place to where everybody knows it, that's where we're at right now.
2495776	2496847	Awesome.
2498100	2499272	And then also,
2499927	2504368	At some point this week I want to dive into the actual
2504348	2508739	Adam, you heard talking about the tech stack and all that, the actual,
2509462	2513363	frameworks and you know, tools and how, you know,
2513798	2515148	databases and all that stuff.
2515289	2517143	I want to just get a full understanding of that as well.
2517425	2518392	But that's not
2518372	2521851	And the music priority, that's what will work out.
2522236	2524635	The list I think my teeny pigs are just...
2525915	2531166	Now that I've met you all, the next step for me really is to
2531770	2536836	get the account set up, log in and then have Ethan walk me through what is
2537609	2541561	what they're using, the accounting folks and the modules.
2541895	2544250	with all of that.
2545136	2545881	And then
2546587	2549442	Scott, meeting with you to understand
2550552	2554352	process, how that works.
2554889	2558925	I want to do this all and what I have a good understanding of our internal
2560255	2565152	People process technology stuff before I start engaging with the client itself.
2565824	2569641	When I engage with the client, I want to sort of, beyond just introductions,
2569840	2573640	Maybe the initial call is just in your production, but I want to also sort of
2574042	2579800	you know, have some slides and talks about, hey, this is the new world we're going to for intake.
2579780	2583192	No longer do you just call Ethan a team.
2583172	2587782	I'm being a little harsh, but this is what the intake process is going to look like.
2588268	2593131	maybe some forms for you to fill out when you have an idea of,
2593111	2598615	the new thing that you want, or maybe this is where you go to see if the system is down,
2598595	2601737	or those kinds of classes of
2602291	2606952	Issue the things that they can tools that we can give them to help themselves.
2607286	2610985	and then if nothing works, then yes, contact Scott.
2611572	2613805	or call this number, whatever it is.
2614711	2616300	And so that's,
2616280	2620620	I want to reach that point before we engage with the clients
2621360	2625784	Then separately I want to talk to them as well to get their side of
2625764	2629363	Why is it that, what is it that is not working for them?
2630770	2631775	And then,
2631755	2637073	Because now right now I'm hearing your side of what's not working.
2637053	2641630	i want to hear their cycle what's not working and then come up the boss there
2641610	2646135	And then we can come up with a proposal for how things should change.
2646588	2649966	and then start living that change, as they say.
2650604	2652555	But that's a little way so I don't.
2653118	2655653	So what's your idea on...
2655633	2660833	Like as far as your time goes, I don't know what your availability is, but
2660813	2666082	Like once we get you set up with access and everything we gotta walk you through that and then
2666062	2670336	Should we just create some calls for you to discuss?
2670760	2670840	Yes.
2670820	2673861	But my lease, once I have the account set up,
2673841	2676486	and I can log in and take a look at stuff.
2676506	2678485	I want to meet with Eaton
2678465	2683564	had him walk me through, hey, this is what the accounting folks are using right now.
2683544	2688053	Then I don't know who can walk me through the JIRA, you know, what are the
2688033	2691511	Issues that have already visited more specifically.
2691531	2693622	I want to understand that
2693602	2696794	Right now, I am...
2697736	2701283	scheduled to spend four hours a day with you guys.
2701263	2704438	And I have some flexibility in terms of
2704418	2709130	So I can work based on what your calendar looks like
2709616	2713146	in terms of eating with each of the folks.
2714054	2718647	And so... Yeah, we'll get a feeling about that whenever we start.
2718627	2719837	getting into talking.
2721088	2722782	Are you in Central Town where you're at?
2722762	2724606	I'm Mountain Tide.
2724708	2726106	Mountain Tide.
2726086	2729768	You know, 8 o'clock, your time, center time,
2729748	2733328	works for me, I can, you know, we can work
2733308	2737513	If we have a calendar that you all share,
2737493	2743150	and also block off times where I have to use and maybe stop.
2743687	2745424	where we're going with that.
2745444	2747807	You can set up my photos and that kind of stuff.
2747787	2748652	Okay.
2750463	2753663	Yeah, I know Ethan's got his daily meeting at 8.30 our time.
2753643	2759046	And then we've got weekly meetings with the team leads
2759026	2763197	9 o'clock on Mondays and 9 o'clock on Thursdays in the morning.
2763177	2768715	but yeah other than that we can we can pretty much work around anything
2769944	2772681	Yeah, I tend to work the mornings
2773960	2777099	You're gonna have to go into the building and other stuff.
2777119	2778729	Yeah, that's fine with us.
2778749	2779212	Yeah, perfect.
2779546	2782036	Cooperate.
2782057	2783008	Excellent.
2784018	2788746	So I make the information on the accounts set up and all of that.
2788726	2793321	I don't know if you're gonna set me up with an internal email address.
2793342	2794450	I believe they are, yeah.
2794430	2799327	okay yeah what's that deal with an email account and like a team's account
2799307	2803110	stuff where you can IM if needed.
2803130	2805283	And I have a Mac machine,
2805871	2806349	Well,
2806681	2808551	that I use, I don't know.
2808793	2810100	We have others with Max.
2810844	2811487	Okay.
2811507	2812573	Not many, but...
2812553	2815577	They do need to just fall back.
2815557	2820235	Yeah, we'll set you up with a VM to where you can remote in and do all your work from there.
2820215	2821604	Good, that's good.
2821624	2822175	Okay, awesome.
2822425	2823997	So then I will look forward to hearing from you.
2824078	2827525	And then my next step will be to meet with Ethan.
2828045	2832334	starts I you know so I'll just work down
2832314	2833542	That'll work?
2834348	2837127	And I'll get you a list of who's who
2837107	2841451	I don't know if I have a picture next to him.
2841471	2842577	I'll get you who too.
2842557	2843828	Great.
2844373	2844756	Excellent.
2844777	2845402	Thank you.
2845443	2846129	This is awesome.
2846230	2847319	Really excited to
2847518	2848572	be working with you all.
2848593	2850458	It's going to be fun stuff.
2851012	2853658	Nice meeting with Krishnan.
2854345	2855233	Nice to meet you.
2855213	2856439	All right.
2856459	2856820	Thank you.
2856840	2857604	We'll talk to you soon.
2857905	2858408	Sounds good.
2859392	2860176	Thank you.
2860196	2860718	See ya.
2868899	2872122	Bye-bye.
2872162	2873290	Meeting's over.
2875582	2881120	I'm optimistic.
2881100	2882029	That's cool.
2882049	2884714	I think if he can help.
2884694	2889743	help us build that middle layer out like to actually be that
2889723	2893759	customer service, product management, product analysis, triage,
2893739	2897235	and actually be, at the end of the day,
2897215	2899108	serving like the end users well.
2899168	2900880	Not that we're not now, but like I said,
2900860	2904407	It is a big, it does create those gaps whenever
2904387	2907529	we do an initial and then we're not really
2907509	2913469	that customer service realm anymore we're just trying you or you guys are trying to code and develop and get it out the door
2913449	2919055	And then you're having to wear all the hats when you do get out the door.
2919035	2924100	with like what's a bug, what's a new feature, what's something we need to roll up.
2924080	2928792	into another iteration what's a brand new thing they want and then meanwhile you're trying to
2928772	2932352	code it all to figure out I think that
2932332	2934264	and just answer questions and call.
2934284	2936638	Like I said, in the past, it's...
2936618	2939642	kind of like we had to be in the beginning.
2939622	2942396	just because there was only so many people here to do it.
2943200	2944587	And now that we're big enough,
2944567	2947860	and we can still grow some more.
2947840	2951556	It sounds like his initial plan is to kind of be that
2951536	2956028	go between and then once he kind of gets a feel for what needs to happen,
2956008	2959082	start developing the treehouse just to move on.
2959062	2963723	I feel like, which I think he'll
2963703	2968110	I feel like what you're doing on the triage is exactly what we need.
2968090	2973055	I just think it needs to be, you guys keep developing and then we need to sell that to the users
2973035	2979045	but like I mean I would envision ever like intake wise like he was everything coming into triage in a tree
2979025	2983180	you're determining where it needs to be flow out from there.
2983160	2986352	maybe we end up having a support team at some point that's just
2986332	2991111	you just hand off to a support team that actually can answer questions, guide people through stuff.
2991091	2996443	to get them through using Confluence on their own, you might have a,
2996423	2997952	something rounded to testing.
2998153	3002316	Like if it seems like it's an actual bug, maybe maybe you need to triage something.
3002296	3006653	and then you would also have the product management that's really
3006633	3009414	the ultimate user interaction.
3009475	3011732	I've been doing a lot of that myself.
3011712	3016660	in the triaging part of this testing and reproducing things that
3016640	3020963	that they report and that seems to work pretty well.
3020943	3025637	Coming from testing, it's been pretty easy for me to do.
3025617	3028742	and see like every development piece we do,
3028722	3032927	even if it's a bug like you find going back through like that.
3032907	3038445	Product management piece and like the product manager or whatever we call it like analysis, whatever and
3038425	3040300	is always that user go-between.
3040320	3043103	They're the ones that like helping build out what the iterations
3043083	3046731	what the releases are, they're the ones doing the user communication.
3046711	3049954	and here's what we're delivering, here's what it's gonna be, what do you need.
3049934	3053987	And like even if you find a bug, kind of route back through them and say, hey,
3053967	3055842	changing this, is this what you're saying?
3056185	3057717	Let them be that go-between.
3057697	3062087	and kill off all the communication that comes directly to not just you but like
3062067	3066053	your team, Conrad's team, Andrew's team, it just, like, it all stops.
3066033	3069916	It all goes through that plug, because right now we just assign it to the team leads.
3069996	3071706	If there's a bug, we can just assign it to him.
3071686	3072814	Yeah.
3072874	3076802	And also, really we have this situation, like,
3076782	3081088	During development phase, we have big gap between user and
3081068	3084480	as developers when there is an issue
3084460	3089172	there's no gap at the immediate quality.
3089152	3095162	There has to be a gap and there has to be a removal of the gap.
3095142	3101119	I'm really interested to see what he thinks about the documents that we've got so far.
3101099	3102951	and what his suggestions would be.
3104259	3106755	So all that stuff is even
3106735	3108430	flowcharted out here, so.
3108612	3110367	Yeah, but I think he's,
3110347	3114484	He reckoned I mean he alluded to it in the call like he's just one person that he can't
3114464	3118500	do that for everyone, but like getting it off the ground here.
3118480	3121504	would be good and that's the one thing I'd like to see
3121484	3125048	the board like a big picture wise if we're looking at this intake of
3125028	3128676	flow that we talked about and there being a product management team we have to
3128656	3132928	that team and that that might mean people from other teams that like.
3132908	3134744	really feel like they're aligned with that.
3134784	3136115	They would love to talk to users.
3136135	3137164	They would love to be that
3137144	3140353	Analysts go between that might mean that we build a team
3140333	3146142	out of our other teams, out of people that really, cause I want people doing like what they love to do.
3146122	3148683	what they're good at doing, get people set up to win.
3149248	3151204	And like if there's people on our other teams
3151184	3154410	like to develop but they feel like this might be a niche then let's
3154390	3157887	let them come in and train and build that out, then we can
3157867	3160907	Again, I'd like to see a pipeline coming up of like
3160887	3162595	That's what I really like to have.
3163017	3164926	Developers are always kind of like you're doing.
3165228	3166594	Developers are coming up.
3166574	3171184	taking on roles that like fit them well and as we have other spots that fit
3171164	3175943	and get them in a place where they can really do well and succeed and help everyone.
3175923	3181613	so it might be that we have to piece together the analysis team
3181593	3185593	from people who would want to do it, would love to do it and do it well.
3185754	3187603	And then we start bringing up more developers
3187583	3188530	to fill those gaps.
3190325	3192683	I don't ever want to get to a spot to where we're like,
3192663	3197712	Say like I mean you coming in and working development wise I know you were fantastic and testing and
3197692	3202133	I don't want to ever be like, well, he'd be good in development, but we can't lose him in testing.
3202282	3203712	I don't want to be that.
3203752	3206672	I want to get people where they want to be and where they can really be.
3206652	3209946	be a star move, so yeah.
3210280	3212166	That's why I mentioned that in the beginning.
3212226	3213321	I'm like, we're not...
3214246	3217590	What we haven't set up now with the different teams and stuff.
3217570	3222147	It doesn't have to be what it is going forward.
3222127	3228036	Like you said, we want to think outside the box if we need to, just to make that process work the best.
3228016	3233352	There is no box.
3233332	3237756	We would need a service and information team like
3237736	3242768	Most of the calls we get from Jayak, it's like they want
3242748	3248404	information from that database or something that has to be
3248384	3249855	done on the database.
3250520	3252555	So it would be better to not
3252535	3258073	like separate from the development team have a service information team yeah
3258053	3262984	that could directly address Jeffs and Jordan's goal or any other team.
3262964	3267102	I think having that division between like
3267807	3270831	who's actually doing it and delivering it.
3270811	3274712	and the users is like a huge because I just got an email from Joe
3274692	3277733	before this meeting where he wants me to write a query
3277713	3283723	And he said, it has payroll data, so he's like, I know you'll end up having to run it, so can you just do it?
3283703	3287279	And some of that, I think.
3287360	3289208	It's like, he knows that like,
3289188	3290418	Ethan can do this.
3290923	3291911	So I'll just call Ethan.
3291931	3292698	Chris can do this.
3292758	3293545	I'll just call Chris.
3293525	3294470	Jacob can do this.
3294551	3295315	I'll just call Jacob.
3295436	3296300	I don't want that.
3296421	3298050	I want it to go through.
3298030	3301712	a funnel that's a team and like whoever's talking to like
3301692	3303749	is never the person to actually deliver.
3303930	3305442	I don't want Jeff to know who does what.
3305422	3309593	I want there to be a person or a team he talks to.
3309573	3314436	And I think that's just good across the board anyway, but that's how all this ends up.
3314416	3317997	In reality, he could have easily sent
3317977	3319977	this request to a triage team.
3320542	3322198	It could have gone through this
3322178	3327598	hand it off to the developer and even if there's not security to run it on production for the payroll stuff
3327578	3329689	It could just be like what you would normally do.
3329709	3331700	You would just send me a script and say, can you run this?
3331740	3332745	I've written everything.
3332725	3333229	Yeah.
3333430	3336271	Like, it doesn't have to come directly to me or directly to you.
3337097	3338145	I don't know how much...
3338395	3344406	We're talking about database, writing database queries and databases in general, and we've got two in over there that does
3344386	3349924	a fantastic job and she got more involved in it you know
3349904	3355915	A lot of those scripts that you end up writing just because you have access to it.
3355895	3358918	She's our database admin.
3358898	3360007	That'd be awesome.
3360673	3364082	And include her as part of the teams, as one of the teams.
3364062	3369735	And even if we had, like in these specific situations where,
3369715	3373583	like Ethan or whoever's writing these don't have access on production.
3375031	3380367	Can't we have something, I know we've talked about doing something
3380347	3384028	in the schism or whatever in the pipelines to where we can throw out
3384008	3388872	Stuff like that where maybe all you got to do is click approve and then it runs it
3388852	3394288	In the banking system we used to have this
3394268	3397461	where whenever we have an issue on production,
3397441	3401410	We, as a developer of our service, we raise a ticket
3401390	3405460	and the ticket directly goes to the in charge product owner
3405440	3409527	And when he approves, he will approve the session.
3409507	3413762	for a certain time, like one hour, half an hour, whatever the time.
3413742	3415438	that requires the job.
3415963	3417255	And once that is done,
3417235	3422385	We will also have logs that monitor our actions and
3422365	3427075	Whenever you want you can just see those logs like what this exact user has done.
3427115	3427296	Yeah
3427276	3429135	from the security point of view.
3429155	3431700	Something like that would be great to build out.
3431680	3437691	I mean that's another scalability thing that we're, what we're doing now isn't scalable, it's just what it's always been.
3437671	3443395	I don't know if this is the right place to ask or not, but I've just always been curious when you write a script like that.
3443375	3448980	and then you send it to somebody else to run, don't you kind of feel like you're flying blind a little bit?
3448960	3450259	Yeah, for sure.
3451213	3451984	Definitely.
3451964	3455950	like when we're dealing with like the employee or payroll data, it's
3455930	3459747	tricky to know if like my script is correct because
3459727	3463695	Jordan a lot of times knows roughly what number he's looking for than what I'm looking for.
3463675	3469585	or especially with payroll data is like millions of dollars different because it's all scrambled, you know.
3474155	3477617	I kind of like that idea though, that you were talking about where it,
3477597	3481330	you approve like a window of time and then just kind of
3481310	3487101	After that it just expires and again you have to price another ticket for that.
3487081	3492771	And we had a project years ago called like data extract that never got out the door.
3492751	3493900	I do remember that.
3493921	3496703	Yeah, but that was the idea of it too, was that
3496683	3501377	like you could just connect to this, and which it's still,
3501357	3506575	the end goal of it is still or the the first iteration still kind of living out there but
3506555	3511992	the users could connect to that service from Excel and just pull like
3511972	3517645	specific views we had written on SQL and they could just load an Excel sheet and manipulate it and then make their own.
3517625	3520648	export files or whatever they needed to do.
3520628	3525610	The idea of that was that like a developer could just write a function or a view
3525590	3529018	let it get deployed and then the user does their own thing if they need
3528998	3532562	And also I thought of one more project like
3532542	3535937	have a service that runs on the production side.
3535917	3539958	where it just tracks the user actions.
3540139	3541607	Like for example,
3541587	3545317	Jeff has done some action like he went to Jack Smith.
3545337	3546889	He did click on this.
3546869	3548761	and this, this, and that.
3548782	3550855	And he came and rose and I don't know.
3550835	3555259	When he calls us, he'll be explaining the whole thing.
3555239	3561250	Instead of him explaining those what he has done we can just go to the server log and
3561230	3562259	and just make those logs.
3562300	3565367	And that would help a little bit with communication too.
3565347	3568168	People are trying to explain what they've done to produce a bug.
3568208	3569316	They miss a couple of things.
3569296	3572657	And they can't replicate the bug anymore.
3572637	3575948	In a limited sense, some of that's...
3576248	3580757	was done in the database where you would have changed by certain
3580737	3585178	But it's kind of like that confirmation thing we've been chasing.
3585158	3588182	What are we missing that she's been doing?
3588162	3589673	It doesn't catch everything.
3589693	3593380	It just checks, OK, this data cell got changed.
3593360	3597531	the state of a row got changed by this person at this time.
3597511	3599284	You don't really know much fun on that.
3599768	3601581	But it is helpful.
3601561	3606576	You can at least see, oh, okay, well, I see when the last time the record was changed and by who.
3606556	3609580	Now we can go back and ask them what they were doing.
3609560	3612207	This way, like you're talking about, we wouldn't necessarily have to do that.
3612369	3613258	They have a record of it.
3613238	3618557	Make notes of all those things, like the SQL access times.
3618537	3624497	the deployment approaches and the like the stack tracing and user step like logging
3624477	3626409	All that stuff's good, just take note of it.
3627094	3628362	Especially as we go through this with
3628342	3632057	we kind of build out what we want our intake and flow to look like.
3632037	3636647	if there's pieces like that that may not be directly part of the flow but we need to add in like we need to
3636627	3638210	note that and remember it.
3638251	3639651	I kind of feel like that's something he'll
3639631	3644359	probably identify like if you're talking about with the logging and stuff like that's somewhere where we're kind of lacking and I feel like
3644339	3650350	maybe that's something he'll bring up that'll help us a ton with like being able to communicate with the users if we can actually see
3650330	3653615	what's going wrong, where the errors happen and stuff.
3653736	3655227	A lot of times,
3655207	3661217	I feel like at least our team, our process is kind of
3661197	3665318	I wouldn't say haphazard, but you know, we don't have like a ton of structure with it.
3665298	3668929	we don't have like very specific requirements for how components should be.
3668909	3671288	implement and stuff, so I write it a little bit differently.
3671308	3673485	So on this page, we may have good error handling on this one.
3673465	3676489	We may not, or we may forget to add logging here.
3676469	3681079	stuff and that's been that's been bittersweet over the years it's been cool because it's it's
3681059	3684083	It's granted a lot of flexibility for teams and developers
3684063	3690073	try new things so like we haven't learned hamstrung people on certain technologies but the other time other side of it
3690053	3694191	we ended up having kind of a wild west of technology approach.
3694171	3697667	It's opened up doors for like
3697647	3701194	learning new things that we wouldn't have learned otherwise but it's also made
3701174	3702726	a lot of problems too.
3702746	3706695	So are you talking about standardizing how apps are written?
3706675	3709834	Where everything has to be more on the structure.
3709814	3714492	and everything has to have a tri-catch and everything has to have
3714472	3718761	Or are you talking more like minting or things like that?
3718741	3721849	Yeah, I feel like having better coding standards might
3721829	3725562	where it doesn't really matter what language you're in, but making sure that like, you know,
3725542	3728683	If you're writing a service or whatever, you need to have like error handled
3728663	3731709	at each step or logging it needs to be in each thing.
3731790	3733020	I don't know.
3733000	3737543	Yeah, like for example logging it seems like a
3737523	3741897	product like we could take over and implement into the apps but
3741877	3744431	It's not as easy as we think.
3744632	3747769	Sometimes we might have to rewrite the whole app as well.
3747749	3751262	because the app was never written to be
3751242	3756578	or to include any logging system into it so yeah it's like
3756558	3760425	Every user control has to be really good WPF and
3760405	3764762	all these different platforms out there that don't talk to each other well.
3764742	3769285	Yeah, which again if you talk to someone, like some developer,
3769265	3774246	If we had to rewrite this whole app, they would not agree.
3774226	3777368	I mean, they would agree, but it's just like, yeah.
3778816	3783055	it feels like a big workout a big project and once we
3783035	3788978	uh step into that project again if we are getting calls from jeff
3788958	3791878	It will break the mold flow.
3792100	3794496	You're going to have somebody to fry in that for you.
3794476	3795914	For sure.
3797395	3801482	very optimistic though yeah i love it
3801462	3807473	I think Zach got the user set up.
3807453	3811763	You're probably good to get that phone and whatnot.
3811803	3813193	Still talks.
3813325	3816940	You can ask about the log and everything.
