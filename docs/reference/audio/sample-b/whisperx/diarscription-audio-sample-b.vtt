WEBVTT

00:34.844 --> 00:39.302
That's a mess over there.

00:39.282 --> 00:44.972
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as bad as it was when I went looking the other weekend.

00:44.952 --> 00:50.136
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny how when you get old, your hair doesn't cover everything anymore.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.675
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll lean forward to that.

00:54.655 --> 01:00.598
[SPEAKER_00]: My Facebook page is getting filled up with hair restoration.

01:00.578 --> 01:04.530
[SPEAKER_00]: ads now.

01:05.894 --> 01:09.745
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna put lotion in my head.

01:09.725 --> 01:11.665
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe you should, I don't know.

01:11.806 --> 01:12.816
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta look it up.

01:13.741 --> 01:18.570
[SPEAKER_01]: I either gotta just shave it off and then, you know, throw some...

01:18.550 --> 01:20.524
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.840
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all kinds of them out there.

01:22.820 --> 01:24.799
[SPEAKER_00]: They all claim to be wonder drugs.

01:25.648 --> 01:26.940
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotin.

01:27.562 --> 01:33.201
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different health food type things they throw in their...

01:33.873 --> 01:39.040
[SPEAKER_00]: Spartan's the one that keeps bombing me.

01:39.425 --> 01:43.630
[SPEAKER_00]: Spartan hair restoration for men.

01:43.610 --> 01:48.523
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be the end-all be-all of hair restoration.

01:48.503 --> 01:52.641
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep getting Spartan ads for racing.

01:53.701 --> 01:54.768
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh really?

01:54.990 --> 01:57.467
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if it's a different thing though.

01:59.607 --> 02:05.618
[SPEAKER_02]: They have SPART exercise equipment and stuff, but I don't know if they do the shampoo.

02:05.598 --> 02:06.390
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:06.471 --> 02:08.217
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

02:09.631 --> 02:15.642
[SPEAKER_02]: I also get ads for the Spartan races, weirdly enough.

02:15.622 --> 02:20.890
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know

02:22.473 --> 02:27.336
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that's from softball, too, apparently.

02:28.767 --> 02:34.761
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably made an all-star team, so my softball season has not ended.

02:34.994 --> 02:36.988
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be over a month ago.

02:38.639 --> 02:40.754
[SPEAKER_01]: All-star team has what?

02:41.540 --> 02:41.983
[SPEAKER_01]: First?

02:42.003 --> 02:42.527
[SPEAKER_01]: Second?

02:42.547 --> 02:42.870
[SPEAKER_01]: First?

02:43.131 --> 02:43.816
[SPEAKER_01]: Third?

02:43.836 --> 02:44.481
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifth?

02:44.900 --> 02:49.003
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our first one just because we never do it.

02:48.983 --> 02:50.313
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only at what grade.

02:50.656 --> 02:51.946
[SPEAKER_01]: How old?

02:52.067 --> 02:53.357
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we go down to fourth?

02:53.337 --> 02:55.353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly what I said.

02:56.421 --> 02:58.538
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my number I did not say.

03:01.471 --> 03:04.208
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we're going, so I won't be here Friday.

03:04.892 --> 03:07.347
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a softball tournament in Paris.

03:07.327 --> 03:10.553
[SPEAKER_01]: Tennessee, yeah.

03:14.262 --> 03:18.805
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not be doing the Branson trip either, so I'll be here.

03:21.974 --> 03:27.782
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Paris, Texas, Paris, Tennessee, Paris, everywhere.

03:30.260 --> 03:31.394
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

03:34.799 --> 03:36.109
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan's out all week.

03:37.298 --> 03:40.219
[SPEAKER_01]: Conrad is here, but at home.

03:40.756 --> 03:44.910
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew is the same.

03:44.890 --> 03:50.563
[SPEAKER_01]: Jacob, same.

03:51.472 --> 03:55.727
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Ethan's got a release for...

03:56.770 --> 04:00.790
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lincoln...

04:00.770 --> 04:04.806
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to try and push up another test file forward.

04:05.410 --> 04:10.206
[SPEAKER_01]: Conrad, we did several things while you were gone.

04:11.047 --> 04:14.863
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to get caught up on that.

04:14.843 --> 04:20.067
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like we'll have the small cabinet order release for a year short goal.

04:20.349 --> 04:20.449
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

04:22.994 --> 04:28.262
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they sent in another small report request I guess this morning.

04:29.423 --> 04:34.219
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the main thing...

04:34.199 --> 04:40.108
[SPEAKER_01]: was we had some more fields in customer service.

04:41.253 --> 04:47.095
[SPEAKER_01]: just for stuff or header options that Eclipse didn't have anywhere that they could look at.

04:47.075 --> 04:50.605
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we're getting them cut off from

04:51.479 --> 04:53.237
[SPEAKER_01]: in that special instruction field.

04:55.816 --> 04:59.649
[SPEAKER_01]: So they added like six fields, I think, in customer service.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.000
[SPEAKER_01]: That hit the trash can.

05:02.009 --> 05:04.760
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was trying to figure out.

05:04.780 --> 05:05.488
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the dripping.

05:07.730 --> 05:09.848
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the dripping is hitting the trash can.

05:10.050 --> 05:12.188
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's going in the trash can.

05:13.484 --> 05:14.383
[SPEAKER_00]: Heh heh.

05:20.386 --> 05:20.896
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

05:28.705 --> 05:34.513
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait until the people on the third floor start complaining about their ceiling tiles going in.

05:34.493 --> 05:39.323
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like he was hitting something flat.

05:41.682 --> 05:44.993
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so...

05:46.525 --> 05:51.928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were able to put the fields in the main

05:51.908 --> 05:57.919
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess in customer service, but they're, I guess wanted to add those to the reports also.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.332
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that ever made a ticket or not.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.821
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the only customer service

06:04.801 --> 06:08.501
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless I missed it, the only customer service ticket I saw was like a rounding issue.

06:09.446 --> 06:09.546
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.173
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have missed it though.

06:12.978 --> 06:14.124
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they did throw one in.

06:14.507 --> 06:15.975
[SPEAKER_01]: That one kind of came in.

06:15.955 --> 06:19.182
[SPEAKER_01]: It came in as another issue from

06:19.820 --> 06:24.683
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason and one of the shop guys.

06:25.237 --> 06:27.990
[SPEAKER_01]: Just asking for more feels.

06:29.607 --> 06:34.453
[SPEAKER_01]: They got that one done, but we'll probably want to put another one in for the reports.

06:35.547 --> 06:36.115
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

06:36.216 --> 06:37.615
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it already on?

06:37.756 --> 06:38.790
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they run a script?

06:38.770 --> 06:41.602
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was just a sequel thing that Blake ran.

06:42.827 --> 06:44.595
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's already out.

06:44.930 --> 06:47.824
[SPEAKER_01]: The new fields are, yes.

06:48.226 --> 06:49.432
[SPEAKER_01]: The reports still have to be done.

06:50.638 --> 06:50.738
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

06:55.983 --> 06:59.867
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like I remember something for customer service related to that.

07:00.910 --> 07:03.698
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be wrong.

07:05.095 --> 07:07.089
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be in Blake's corner.

07:07.109 --> 07:08.357
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't see.

07:08.377 --> 07:10.008
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

07:10.028 --> 07:10.431
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you say?

07:11.575 --> 07:16.793
[SPEAKER_02]: i could see the one i was looking for the signs of life too so okay um

07:17.431 --> 07:20.432
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one that had something to do with like a rounding issue.

07:20.935 --> 07:22.949
[SPEAKER_02]: That was new in customer service.

07:22.969 --> 07:23.070
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

07:26.442 --> 07:32.031
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah those are the biggies that came last week

07:32.011 --> 07:35.035
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll let you get caught up.

07:35.453 --> 07:41.076
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything on your side as far as those fields go that we needed to worry about?

07:42.035 --> 07:44.248
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to get everything you need?

07:44.651 --> 07:46.341
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you're already getting it?

07:47.738 --> 07:53.074
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those Power BI reports, those are the ones you were talking about with the added fields, right?

07:53.408 --> 07:53.974
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

07:54.176 --> 07:56.500
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know I passed one like that over to you.

07:57.678 --> 08:02.052
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's another Power BI issue that had to do with Duke's Kid.

08:02.892 --> 08:04.938
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.

08:04.958 --> 08:05.950
[SPEAKER_01]: Good idea of these.

08:07.533 --> 08:09.162
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a weird morning.

08:09.887 --> 08:13.105
[SPEAKER_01]: There were several issues that came up and they were all different.

08:13.085 --> 08:17.003
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the one that I sent to Greg

08:16.983 --> 08:20.715
[SPEAKER_00]: where the Power BI and the columns initially went to again.

08:21.404 --> 08:24.867
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Tuyen says she didn't have access to change the report.

08:24.847 --> 08:29.220
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out Greg was working on something similar anyway.

08:29.757 --> 08:30.301
[SPEAKER_00]: He took it.

08:30.322 --> 08:34.435
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that one played ping pong a minute.

08:35.242 --> 08:38.232
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like...

08:39.410 --> 08:42.197
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes, it was figured out.

08:47.932 --> 08:53.841
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I sent you a text.

08:53.821 --> 08:55.107
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

08:56.285 --> 09:00.844
[SPEAKER_01]: Those reports that went to RSI, the load reports.

09:00.824 --> 09:02.671
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

09:02.975 --> 09:03.645
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.843
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it went out just fine.

09:06.863 --> 09:09.597
[SPEAKER_01]: They just didn't see it yet or it went to their junk.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.260
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.184
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would make sense.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.192
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken never

09:14.172 --> 09:17.884
[SPEAKER_01]: replied after I said that it looked like it went.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.356
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked through SendGrid.

09:19.336 --> 09:24.807
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looked good there, looked like it had been delivered, just not opened.

09:24.787 --> 09:28.890
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that one's a non-issue.

09:28.870 --> 09:30.629
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point.

09:30.811 --> 09:32.873
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in and found that

09:33.393 --> 09:38.037
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the email and the messaging server or the messaging database and got the file.

09:38.017 --> 09:41.378
[SPEAKER_01]: to send it in manually if we needed to.

09:41.358 --> 09:44.989
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sent it to him, but I don't know if he actually had to use it or not.

09:45.644 --> 09:47.841
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, we didn't have to do anything.

09:51.331 --> 09:54.505
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense because it hasn't failed in a long time.

09:54.525 --> 09:55.435
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that's what I said.

09:55.415 --> 09:57.265
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like we haven't looked at this in a long time.

09:58.210 --> 10:00.784
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we can get to those files

10:00.764 --> 10:06.403
[SPEAKER_00]: From our network, we have to go into the production VM and get it from there, right?

10:06.383 --> 10:11.365
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I tried that and I was, wait, there's nothing in here.

10:11.632 --> 10:12.436
[SPEAKER_00]: from this year.

10:13.039 --> 10:13.923
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

10:14.084 --> 10:17.440
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Prada Fest is a different Prada Fest.

10:18.365 --> 10:19.567
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.743
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything going to production this week or anything going to testing this week?

10:29.414 --> 10:29.877
[SPEAKER_01]: At least wise.

10:30.818 --> 10:31.751
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything interesting?

10:36.623 --> 10:42.263
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we have anything interesting.

10:45.112 --> 10:50.295
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you gotten any word from battles on monitors?

10:52.452 --> 10:58.362
[SPEAKER_01]: They may want to wait and move you guys after we get the server room moved.

10:58.932 --> 11:04.943
[SPEAKER_01]: did they get access points put in over there

11:04.923 --> 11:05.100
[SPEAKER_01]: you.

11:08.635 --> 11:09.984
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's walk over there.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.823
[SPEAKER_01]: Look around.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.022
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the main issue.

11:15.063 --> 11:16.519
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't move you over there.

11:16.499 --> 11:19.692
[SPEAKER_01]: after we knew the Wi-Fi was working,

11:19.672 --> 11:23.410
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get around that wall, you don't get anything from over here.

11:23.431 --> 11:25.581
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to put one over there.

11:25.561 --> 11:29.091
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you guys get moved over there, I'm gonna lose my chill chair.

11:30.218 --> 11:35.655
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the one that's way back there in the corner, that's next to the window.

11:35.635 --> 11:39.165
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I take my breaks, I go over and sit in that chair and look out the window.

11:41.457 --> 11:42.381
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll still be there.

11:43.144 --> 11:44.088
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they'll be there.

11:44.490 --> 11:47.282
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mess with them, and I don't want them to mess with me.

11:47.465 --> 11:49.729
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.

11:50.637 --> 11:52.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

11:53.063 --> 11:54.336
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll find another place.

12:02.804 --> 12:05.389
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'll be on Friday.

12:05.430 --> 12:06.520
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan's out all week.

12:07.850 --> 12:11.717
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully no big goals this week.

12:12.322 --> 12:14.314
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ethan is, he's going to be out all week.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.573
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

12:18.295 --> 12:20.064
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the team is prepared.

12:20.767 --> 12:23.260
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dustin Hodges that works with

12:24.320 --> 12:26.274
[SPEAKER_01]: in accounting down there?

12:26.395 --> 12:27.886
[SPEAKER_01]: Dustin actually does the sales stuff.

12:28.248 --> 12:28.812
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

12:28.792 --> 12:31.425
[SPEAKER_00]: He preached at our church this weekend.

12:31.727 --> 12:32.068
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

12:32.350 --> 12:32.611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

12:33.375 --> 12:34.802
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool.

12:34.782 --> 12:36.370
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you from somewhere.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.902
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yeah, I know you work at WWM.

12:39.082 --> 12:40.489
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the whole conversation.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.999
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of a, one of those

12:45.633 --> 12:48.803
[SPEAKER_00]: coincidence sort of things.

12:49.106 --> 12:49.348
Interesting.

12:51.100 --> 12:55.609
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said I'll be out Friday.

12:59.386 --> 13:04.654
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be out next week.

13:06.575 --> 13:07.460
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg's out next week.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.100
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else out coming up before?

13:12.059 --> 13:12.703
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer ends.

13:14.976 --> 13:16.888
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the whole death cotton thing coming out.

13:17.310 --> 13:17.833
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

13:18.337 --> 13:21.208
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what was it?

13:22.825 --> 13:23.390
[SPEAKER_02]: August.

13:24.015 --> 13:24.902
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the first week of August?

13:26.011 --> 13:26.878
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the

13:27.550 --> 13:30.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, technically the August 1st is a Friday

13:32.056 --> 13:33.546
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be like a week after that.

13:35.942 --> 13:36.325
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

13:36.345 --> 13:38.016
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the official dates.

13:38.738 --> 13:40.449
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're out there.

13:40.891 --> 13:44.614
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like the first Tuesday

13:45.218 --> 13:45.922
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

13:45.942 --> 13:46.042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

13:46.143 --> 13:48.958
[SPEAKER_02]: Flying back that next Monday.

13:48.978 --> 13:50.908
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were flying back that Sunday.

13:51.192 --> 13:53.930
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently we're flying back that Monday.

13:55.077 --> 13:55.178
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

13:57.503 --> 13:57.967
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

13:59.337 --> 14:02.138
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew, you got any facts?

14:02.159 --> 14:02.924
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

14:02.945 --> 14:03.025
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

14:04.237 --> 14:04.741
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

14:04.882 --> 14:06.414
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one fact.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.336
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have used it, but it was a while ago if I did.

14:09.822 --> 14:14.533
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think this is a cool concept, but China's the only

14:14.513 --> 14:20.203
[SPEAKER_03]: country in the world with giant pandas and they have what they call panda

14:20.183 --> 14:24.102
[SPEAKER_03]: diplomacy, which is basically if they're on good terms with

14:24.470 --> 14:29.670
[SPEAKER_03]: they will lend you a panda to have in your zoo and if they

14:30.342 --> 14:34.058
[SPEAKER_03]: your country does something that they do not like.

14:34.409 --> 14:37.585
[SPEAKER_03]: they will recall the pandas and ship them back to China.

14:38.408 --> 14:43.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently there are four in the United States in various cities.

14:44.247 --> 14:48.604
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are at least 25 zoos worldwide.

14:49.124 --> 14:51.379
[SPEAKER_03]: that have Chinese pandas.

14:52.486 --> 14:53.231
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, doesn't St.

14:53.271 --> 14:54.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Louis still have one?

14:54.258 --> 14:54.882
They used to.

14:56.279 --> 14:57.448
I think so.

14:57.952 --> 14:59.927
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

14:59.907 --> 15:02.681
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw on the Wikipedia page it mentioned St.

15:02.701 --> 15:05.918
[SPEAKER_03]: Louis as one of the first zoos to have one.

15:05.898 --> 15:11.183
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like that would be a very strong diplomatic

15:11.163 --> 15:13.478
[SPEAKER_00]: leveraging point, you know?

15:14.099 --> 15:18.810
[SPEAKER_00]: You better recall those tariffs and we're going to take our pandas back.

15:19.212 --> 15:21.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

15:22.402 --> 15:26.956
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's just supposed to keep it in the news.

15:27.016 --> 15:27.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

15:27.802 --> 15:31.872
[SPEAKER_03]: where I was like, is not happy about something.

15:33.252 --> 15:38.470
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder that like you got all these different species that live everywhere

15:38.450 --> 15:43.262
[SPEAKER_01]: What's keeping other countries from

15:43.242 --> 15:46.097
[SPEAKER_01]: starting their own population, though.

15:47.782 --> 15:52.223
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a major scandal if we started...

15:52.203 --> 15:53.735
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding operations.

15:54.077 --> 15:56.475
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, our own panda population.

15:56.793 --> 15:58.220
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe China controls it.

15:58.260 --> 16:00.491
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only going to send you boy pandas.

16:00.511 --> 16:00.611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

16:02.079 --> 16:02.601
[SPEAKER_03]: I think

16:02.885 --> 16:08.068
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there have been babies born in American zoos,

16:08.048 --> 16:11.967
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think per the agreement they belong to China,

16:11.947 --> 16:17.957
[SPEAKER_03]: so they may let us keep them, but they can still take them back.

16:17.937 --> 16:18.146
you

16:24.130 --> 16:25.282
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

16:26.932 --> 16:27.636
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

16:28.441 --> 16:29.567
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll be a quiet week.

16:30.834 --> 16:31.558
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

16:31.775 --> 16:33.942
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no releases going out, so.

16:34.225 --> 16:34.731
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

16:35.892 --> 16:39.751
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, thanks guys.

16:39.831 --> 16:40.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, bye.

16:49.021 --> 16:53.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

16:53.797 --> 16:55.487
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacation Bible School.

17:01.424 --> 17:07.401
[SPEAKER_01]: They redid the school's sound system in the gym.

17:07.381 --> 17:10.219
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot easier.

17:11.026 --> 17:14.047
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't have anything.

17:14.067 --> 17:14.168
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

17:14.148 --> 17:20.158
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little small church and our gym is in the parking lot and it has a broken basketball goal.

17:20.138 --> 17:20.300
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

17:32.069 --> 17:36.963
[SPEAKER_01]: and it goes through all the speakers.

17:36.983 --> 17:37.084
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

17:37.672 --> 17:40.525
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a distribution amp, but we don't use it really.

17:40.846 --> 17:43.277
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all these different channels on it.

17:43.257 --> 17:48.525
[SPEAKER_00]: control like you can make the sound come out of wherever you want it to come out of but

17:49.248 --> 17:52.331
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have two speakers.

17:52.351 --> 17:54.870
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even know why they bought it to put it in.

17:55.137 --> 17:57.094
[SPEAKER_00]: I think actually, I think it was all donated.

17:57.699 --> 17:59.070
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's cool.

17:59.191 --> 17:59.292
Yeah.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.170
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're like, well, it's donated.

18:03.190 --> 18:04.506
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and put it in.

18:06.832 --> 18:08.645
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a while to figure that one out.

18:08.665 --> 18:12.572
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, where's the sound?

18:13.126 --> 18:16.251
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn this thing on.

18:19.673 --> 18:22.994
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, ours is really simple.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.705
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 16 channel

18:25.107 --> 18:30.595
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix Master, Heath Allen, and that's pretty much the only thing you have to deal with.

18:30.575 --> 18:35.826
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to turn on the amp in the back and turn on the different channels?

18:36.228 --> 18:39.775
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need to know.

18:47.973 --> 18:53.292
[SPEAKER_01]: to it or whatever you're plugging into it it's all built on the screen

18:57.862 --> 19:01.711
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's a lot more compact to a big mix of lines like.

19:01.751 --> 19:03.282
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
