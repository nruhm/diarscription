34844	39302	That's a mess over there.
39282	44972	It's not as bad as it was when I went looking the other weekend.
44952	50136	It's funny how when you get old, your hair doesn't cover everything anymore.
51652	54675	I'll lean forward to that.
54655	60598	My Facebook page is getting filled up with hair restoration.
60578	64530	ads now.
65894	69745	I'm not gonna put lotion in my head.
69725	71665	Or maybe you should, I don't know.
71806	72816	I gotta look it up.
73741	78570	I either gotta just shave it off and then, you know, throw some...
78550	80524	I don't know.
81148	82840	There are all kinds of them out there.
82820	84799	They all claim to be wonder drugs.
85648	86940	Biotin.
87562	93201	All these different health food type things they throw in their...
93873	99040	Spartan's the one that keeps bombing me.
99425	103630	Spartan hair restoration for men.
103610	108523	It's supposed to be the end-all be-all of hair restoration.
108503	112641	I keep getting Spartan ads for racing.
113701	114768	Oh really?
114990	117467	I wonder if it's a different thing though.
119607	125618	They have SPART exercise equipment and stuff, but I don't know if they do the shampoo.
125598	126390	Yeah.
126471	128217	Yeah.
129631	135642	I also get ads for the Spartan races, weirdly enough.
135622	140890	so you know
142473	147336	Some of that's from softball, too, apparently.
148767	154761	So probably made an all-star team, so my softball season has not ended.
154994	156988	It was supposed to be over a month ago.
158639	160754	All-star team has what?
161540	161983	First?
162003	162527	Second?
162547	162870	First?
163131	163816	Third?
163836	164481	Fifth?
164900	169003	This is our first one just because we never do it.
168983	170313	Not only at what grade.
170656	171946	How old?
172067	173357	Should we go down to fourth?
173337	175353	Yeah, that's exactly what I said.
176421	178538	Oh, my number I did not say.
181471	184208	Yeah, and we're going, so I won't be here Friday.
184892	187347	We've got a softball tournament in Paris.
187327	190553	Tennessee, yeah.
194262	198805	I will not be doing the Branson trip either, so I'll be here.
201974	207782	It's like Paris, Texas, Paris, Tennessee, Paris, everywhere.
210260	211394	Um...
214799	216109	Ethan's out all week.
217298	220219	Conrad is here, but at home.
220756	224910	Andrew is the same.
224890	230563	Jacob, same.
231472	235727	I know Ethan's got a release for...
236770	240790	The Lincoln...
240770	244806	And we're going to try and push up another test file forward.
245410	250206	Conrad, we did several things while you were gone.
251047	254863	I was trying to get caught up on that.
254843	260067	Sounds like we'll have the small cabinet order release for a year short goal.
260349	260449	Yeah.
262994	268262	Yeah, they sent in another small report request I guess this morning.
269423	274219	But I guess the main thing...
274199	280108	was we had some more fields in customer service.
281253	287095	just for stuff or header options that Eclipse didn't have anywhere that they could look at.
287075	290605	and then we're getting them cut off from
291479	293237	in that special instruction field.
295816	299649	So they added like six fields, I think, in customer service.
300133	301000	That hit the trash can.
302009	304760	That's what I was trying to figure out.
304780	305488	Yeah, the dripping.
307730	309848	I believe the dripping is hitting the trash can.
310050	312188	I don't know if it's going in the trash can.
313484	314383	Heh heh.
320386	320896	So.
328705	334513	Just wait until the people on the third floor start complaining about their ceiling tiles going in.
334493	339323	It sounded like he was hitting something flat.
341682	344993	Uh, so...
346525	351928	Yeah, they were able to put the fields in the main
351908	357919	I guess in customer service, but they're, I guess wanted to add those to the reports also.
357899	360332	I don't know if that ever made a ticket or not.
361240	364821	I saw the only customer service
364801	368501	Unless I missed it, the only customer service ticket I saw was like a rounding issue.
369446	369546	Okay.
370403	372173	I might have missed it though.
372978	374124	I don't think they did throw one in.
374507	375975	That one kind of came in.
375955	379182	It came in as another issue from
379820	384683	Jason and one of the shop guys.
385237	387990	Just asking for more feels.
389607	394453	They got that one done, but we'll probably want to put another one in for the reports.
395547	396115	Okay.
396216	397615	But is it already on?
397756	398790	Did they run a script?
398770	401602	Yeah, it was just a sequel thing that Blake ran.
402827	404595	So that's already out.
404930	407824	The new fields are, yes.
408226	409432	The reports still have to be done.
410638	410738	Okay.
415983	419867	It seems like I remember something for customer service related to that.
420910	423698	Could be wrong.
425095	427089	It could be in Blake's corner.
427109	428357	He doesn't see.
428377	430008	I don't know.
430028	430431	What did you say?
431575	436793	i could see the one i was looking for the signs of life too so okay um
437431	440432	There's another one that had something to do with like a rounding issue.
440935	442949	That was new in customer service.
442969	443070	Okay.
446442	452031	yeah those are the biggies that came last week
452011	455035	So we'll let you get caught up.
455453	461076	Was there anything on your side as far as those fields go that we needed to worry about?
462035	464248	You're able to get everything you need?
464651	466341	Or you're already getting it?
467738	473074	Yeah, those Power BI reports, those are the ones you were talking about with the added fields, right?
473408	473974	Yeah.
474176	476500	Because I know I passed one like that over to you.
477678	482052	Well, there's another Power BI issue that had to do with Duke's Kid.
482892	484938	Oh, right.
484958	485950	Good idea of these.
487533	489162	Yeah, that was a weird morning.
489887	493105	There were several issues that came up and they were all different.
493085	497003	Yeah, the one that I sent to Greg
496983	500715	where the Power BI and the columns initially went to again.
501404	504867	And then Tuyen says she didn't have access to change the report.
504847	509220	And it turns out Greg was working on something similar anyway.
509757	510301	He took it.
510322	514435	So yeah, that one played ping pong a minute.
515242	518232	But it was like...
519410	522197	Five minutes, it was figured out.
527932	533841	I think I sent you a text.
533821	535107	Um...
536285	540844	Those reports that went to RSI, the load reports.
540824	542671	Yeah.
542975	543645	Yeah.
544250	546843	I think it went out just fine.
546863	549597	They just didn't see it yet or it went to their junk.
549617	550260	I don't know.
550240	553184	Yeah, that would make sense.
553204	554192	Ken never
554172	557884	replied after I said that it looked like it went.
557924	559356	We looked through SendGrid.
559336	564807	Everything looked good there, looked like it had been delivered, just not opened.
564787	568890	So I think that one's a non-issue.
568870	570629	at this point.
570811	572873	I went in and found that
573393	578037	It's on the email and the messaging server or the messaging database and got the file.
578017	581378	to send it in manually if we needed to.
581358	584989	And I sent it to him, but I don't know if he actually had to use it or not.
585644	587841	So no, we didn't have to do anything.
591331	594505	That makes sense because it hasn't failed in a long time.
594525	595435	Right, that's what I said.
595415	597265	Sounds like we haven't looked at this in a long time.
598210	600784	I don't think we can get to those files
600764	606403	From our network, we have to go into the production VM and get it from there, right?
606383	611365	Okay, so I tried that and I was, wait, there's nothing in here.
611632	612436	from this year.
613039	613923	Yeah.
614084	617440	Our Prada Fest is a different Prada Fest.
618365	619567	Right.
624440	627743	Anything going to production this week or anything going to testing this week?
629414	629877	At least wise.
630818	631751	You got anything interesting?
636623	642263	I don't think we have anything interesting.
645112	650295	Have you gotten any word from battles on monitors?
652452	658362	They may want to wait and move you guys after we get the server room moved.
658932	664943	did they get access points put in over there
664923	665100	you.
668635	669984	Let's walk over there.
670044	672823	Look around.
673040	675022	That was the main issue.
675063	676519	We didn't move you over there.
676499	679692	after we knew the Wi-Fi was working,
679672	683410	Once you get around that wall, you don't get anything from over here.
683431	685581	So we had to put one over there.
685561	689091	Once you guys get moved over there, I'm gonna lose my chill chair.
690218	695655	Yeah, the one that's way back there in the corner, that's next to the window.
695635	699165	So when I take my breaks, I go over and sit in that chair and look out the window.
701457	702381	I'll still be there.
703144	704088	Yeah, but they'll be there.
704490	707282	I don't want to mess with them, and I don't want them to mess with me.
707465	709729	Yeah, that's true.
710637	712436	Right.
713063	714336	I'll find another place.
722804	725389	Like I said, I'll be on Friday.
725430	726520	Ethan's out all week.
727850	731717	Hopefully no big goals this week.
732322	734314	So Ethan is, he's going to be out all week.
734777	737573	Okay.
738295	740064	The rest of the team is prepared.
740767	743260	So Dustin Hodges that works with
744320	746274	in accounting down there?
746395	747886	Dustin actually does the sales stuff.
748248	748812	Right.
748792	751425	He preached at our church this weekend.
751727	752068	Oh, really?
752350	752611	Yeah.
753375	754802	That was pretty cool.
754782	756370	I know you from somewhere.
756410	758902	And he said, yeah, I know you work at WWM.
759082	760489	We had the whole conversation.
760469	763999	That was kind of a, one of those
765633	768803	coincidence sort of things.
769106	769348	Interesting.
771100	775609	Like I said I'll be out Friday.
779386	784654	I'm going to be out next week.
786575	787460	Greg's out next week.
787480	791100	Anybody else out coming up before?
792059	792703	Summer ends.
794976	796888	It's got the whole death cotton thing coming out.
797310	797833	That's right.
798337	801208	I mean, what was it?
802825	803390	August.
804015	804902	Is that the first week of August?
806011	806878	It's like the
807550	810557	Well, technically the August 1st is a Friday
812056	813546	It'll be like a week after that.
815942	816325	Okay.
816345	818016	It's the official dates.
818738	820449	Yeah, they're out there.
820891	824614	I think it's like the first Tuesday
825218	825922	Okay.
825942	826042	Yeah.
826143	828958	Flying back that next Monday.
828978	830908	I thought we were flying back that Sunday.
831192	833930	But apparently we're flying back that Monday.
835077	835178	Okay.
837503	837967	All right.
839337	842138	Andrew, you got any facts?
842159	842924	Can you hear me?
842945	843025	Yep.
844237	844741	All right.
844882	846414	I have one fact.
846595	849336	I may have used it, but it was a while ago if I did.
849822	854533	I still think this is a cool concept, but China's the only
854513	860203	country in the world with giant pandas and they have what they call panda
860183	864102	diplomacy, which is basically if they're on good terms with
864470	869670	they will lend you a panda to have in your zoo and if they
870342	874058	your country does something that they do not like.
874409	877585	they will recall the pandas and ship them back to China.
878408	883744	Currently there are four in the United States in various cities.
884247	888604	And there are at least 25 zoos worldwide.
889124	891379	that have Chinese pandas.
892486	893231	Look, doesn't St.
893271	894077	Louis still have one?
894258	894882	They used to.
896279	897448	I think so.
897952	899927	Yeah, I think so.
899907	902681	I saw on the Wikipedia page it mentioned St.
902701	905918	Louis as one of the first zoos to have one.
905898	911183	It doesn't seem like that would be a very strong diplomatic
911163	913478	leveraging point, you know?
914099	918810	You better recall those tariffs and we're going to take our pandas back.
919212	921831	Thank you.
922402	926956	Well, I think it's just supposed to keep it in the news.
927016	927822	Right.
927802	931872	where I was like, is not happy about something.
933252	938470	I wonder that like you got all these different species that live everywhere
938450	943262	What's keeping other countries from
943242	946097	starting their own population, though.
947782	952223	That would be a major scandal if we started...
952203	953735	breeding operations.
954077	956475	Yeah, our own panda population.
956793	958220	Maybe China controls it.
958260	960491	We're only going to send you boy pandas.
960511	960611	Yeah.
962079	962601	I think
962885	968068	I know that there have been babies born in American zoos,
968048	971967	but I think per the agreement they belong to China,
971947	977957	so they may let us keep them, but they can still take them back.
977937	978146	you
984130	985282	Alright.
986932	987636	Nice.
988441	989567	Maybe it'll be a quiet week.
990834	991558	Yeah.
991775	993942	Yeah, no releases going out, so.
994225	994731	Right.
995892	999751	Alright, thanks guys.
999831	1000215	Alright, bye.
1009021	1013125	Oh, yeah.
1013797	1015487	Vacation Bible School.
1021424	1027401	They redid the school's sound system in the gym.
1027381	1030219	So it's a lot easier.
1031026	1034047	but I don't have anything.
1034067	1034168	Yeah.
1034148	1040158	We have a little small church and our gym is in the parking lot and it has a broken basketball goal.
1040138	1040300	Bye.
1052069	1056963	and it goes through all the speakers.
1056983	1057084	Cool.
1057672	1060525	We've got a distribution amp, but we don't use it really.
1060846	1063277	It's got all these different channels on it.
1063257	1068525	control like you can make the sound come out of wherever you want it to come out of but
1069248	1072331	We only have two speakers.
1072351	1074870	So I don't even know why they bought it to put it in.
1075137	1077094	I think actually, I think it was all donated.
1077699	1079070	Yeah, that's cool.
1079191	1079292	Yeah.
1081347	1083170	So we're like, well, it's donated.
1083190	1084506	Let's go ahead and put it in.
1086832	1088645	It took me a while to figure that one out.
1088665	1092572	I was like, where's the sound?
1093126	1096251	Turn this thing on.
1099673	1102994	Yeah, ours is really simple.
1103014	1104705	We have a 16 channel
1105107	1110595	Mix Master, Heath Allen, and that's pretty much the only thing you have to deal with.
1110575	1115826	Do you know how to turn on the amp in the back and turn on the different channels?
1116228	1119775	That's all you need to know.
1127973	1133292	to it or whatever you're plugging into it it's all built on the screen
1137862	1141711	Yeah, but it's a lot more compact to a big mix of lines like.
1141751	1143282	Yeah.
