1
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:39,302
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a mess over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ceiling collapsed 

2
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:44,972
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as bad as it was when I went looking the other weekend, but yeah. 

3
00:00:44,952 --> 00:00:50,136
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny how when you get old, your hair doesn't cover everything anymore.

4
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that. 
[SPEAKER_01]: Mhm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I just won't get old. 

5
00:00:54,655 --> 00:01:00,598
[SPEAKER_00]: My Facebook page is getting filled up with hair restoration.

6
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:04,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, ads now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

7
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:09,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna put lotion in my head.

8
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:11,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe you should, I don't know.

9
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:12,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta look it up.

10
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:18,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I either gotta just shave it off and then, you know, throw some...

11
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,524
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suncreen or...

12
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,840
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all kinds of them out there.

13
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,799
[SPEAKER_00]: They all claim to be wonder drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. 

14
00:01:25,648 --> 00:01:26,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotin.

15
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:33,201
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different health food type things they throw in there...

16
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:39,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Spartan's the one that keeps bombing me.

17
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:43,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Spartan hair restoration for men.

18
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,523
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be the end-all be-all of hair restoration.

19
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:52,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep getting Spartan ads for racing.

20
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh really?

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,467
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if it's a different thing though.

22
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:05,618
[SPEAKER_02]: They have Spartan exercise equipment and stuff, but I don't know if they do the shampoo. It's probably somebody different.

23
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:06,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

24
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably. 

25
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:15,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I also get ads for the Spartan races, weirdly enough.

26
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:20,890
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know

27
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:27,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that's from softball, too, apparently.

28
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:34,761
[SPEAKER_01]: So she made the all-star team, so my softball season has not ended.

29
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:36,988
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be over a month ago.

30
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,754
[SPEAKER_02]: All-star team as what?

31
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:41,983
[SPEAKER_02]: First?

32
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:42,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Second?

33
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:42,870
[SPEAKER_02]: First?

34
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:43,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Third?

35
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:44,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth?

36
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,003
[SPEAKER_01]: This is her first one just because we never do it.

37
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:50,313
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I meant what grade

38
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:51,946
[SPEAKER_01]: How old?

39
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be going into fourth?

40
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:55,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly what I said.

41
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:58,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the number I did not say.

42
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:04,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we're going, so I won't be here Friday.

43
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,347
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a softball tournament in Paris.

44
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:10,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paris, Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. 

45
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:18,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not be doing the Branson trip either, so I'll be here.

46
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:27,782
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Paris, Texas, Paris, Tennessee, Paris, everywhere.

47
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

48
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan's out all week.

49
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:40,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Conrad is here, but at home.

50
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:44,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Andrew is the same.

51
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:50,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Jacob, same.

52
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:55,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I know Ethan's got a release for...

53
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,790
[SPEAKER_01]: The, um, Lincoln file.

54
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,806
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to try and push up another test file forward.

55
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Conrad, we did several things while you were gone.

56
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:14,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to get caught up on that.

57
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:20,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like we'll have the small cabinet order released here shortly.

58
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:20,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

59
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:28,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they sent in another small report request I guess this morning.

60
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:34,219
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the main thing...

61
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,108
[SPEAKER_01]: was we had some more fields in customer service.

62
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:47,095
[SPEAKER_01]: just for stuff or header options that Eclipse didn't have anywhere that they could look at.

63
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:50,605
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were getting them cut off from

64
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,237
[SPEAKER_01]: in that special instructions field.

65
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:59,649
[SPEAKER_01]: So they added like six fields, I think, in customer service.

66
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,000
[SPEAKER_01]: That hit the trash can.

67
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,760
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was trying to figure out.

68
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the dripping.

69
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,848
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the dripping is hitting the trash can.

70
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's going in the trash can.

71
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:14,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Heh heh.

72
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:20,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

73
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:34,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait until the people on the third floor start complaining about their ceiling tiles going in.

74
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:39,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounded like it was hitting something flat.

75
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:44,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so...

76
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:51,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were able to put the fields in the main form

77
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:57,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess in customer service, but they're, I guess wanted to add those to the reports also.

78
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that ever made a ticket or not.

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see one. I saw the only customer service

80
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:08,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless I missed it, the only customer service ticket I saw was like a rounding issue.

81
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:09,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

82
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have missed it though.

83
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they did put one in.

84
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,975
[SPEAKER_01]: That one kind of came in.

85
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:19,182
[SPEAKER_01]: It came in as another issue from

86
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason and one of the shop guys.

87
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Just asking for more fields.

88
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:34,453
[SPEAKER_01]: They got that one done, but we'll probably want to put another one in for the reports.

89
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:36,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

90
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:37,615
[SPEAKER_03]: But is it already on?

91
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:38,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they run a script?

92
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was just a sequel thing that Blake ran.

93
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:44,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's already out?

94
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,824
[SPEAKER_01]: The new fields are, yes.

95
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:49,432
[SPEAKER_01]: The reports still have to be done.

96
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:50,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

97
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:59,867
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like I remember something for customer service related to that.

98
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be wrong.

99
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:07,089
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be in Blake's corner.

100
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:08,357
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't see.

101
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:10,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

102
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:10,431
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you say?

103
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:16,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see the one i was looking for, the one assigned to Blake too, so...

104
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:20,432
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one that had something to do with like a rounding issue.

105
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:22,949
[SPEAKER_03]: That was new in customer service.

106
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:23,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

107
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:32,031
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah those are the biggies that came last week

108
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:35,035
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll let you get caught up.

109
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:41,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything on your side as far as those fields go that we needed to worry about?

110
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:44,248
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to get everything you need?

111
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:46,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you're already getting it?

112
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:53,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those Power BI reports, those are the ones you were talking about with the added fields, right?

113
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:53,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

114
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:56,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know I passed one like that over to you.

115
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:02,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's another Power BI issue that had to do with.

116
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:04,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.

117
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Good idea of these.

118
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a weird morning.

119
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:13,105
[SPEAKER_01]: There was several issues that came up and they were all different.

120
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:17,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the one that I sent to Greg

121
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:20,715
[SPEAKER_00]: where the Power BI and the columns initially went to Tuyen.

122
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:24,867
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Tuyen says she didn't have access to change the report.

123
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:29,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out Greg was working on something similar anyway.

124
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:30,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So, he took it.

125
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:34,435
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that one played ping pong a minute.

126
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:38,232
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like...

127
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes, it was figured out.

128
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:53,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And Conrad, I think I sent you a text.

129
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:55,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

130
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Those reports that went to RSI, the load reports.

131
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

132
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

133
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it went out just fine.

134
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:09,597
[SPEAKER_01]: They just didn't see it yet or it went to their junk.

135
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:10,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

136
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would make sense.

137
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:14,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken never

138
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:17,884
[SPEAKER_01]: replied after I said that it looked like it went.

139
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,356
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked through SendGrid.

140
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:24,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looked good there, it looked like it had been delivered, just not opened.

141
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:28,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that one's a non-issue.

142
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,629
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't have to do anything?

143
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in and found that

144
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:38,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Found the email and the messaging server or the messaging database and got the file.

145
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:41,378
[SPEAKER_01]: to send it in manually if we needed to.

146
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:44,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sent it to him, but I don't know if he actually had to use it or not.

147
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:47,841
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, we didn't have to do anything.

148
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:54,505
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense because it hasn't failed in a long time.

149
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:55,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that's what I said.

150
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like we haven't looked at this in a long time.

151
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,784
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we can get to those files

152
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:06,403
[SPEAKER_00]: From our network, we have to go into the production VM and get it from there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

153
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:11,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I tried that and I was, wait, there's nothing in here.

154
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:12,436
[SPEAKER_00]: from this year.

155
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

156
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:17,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Prod FS is a different Prod FS.

157
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:19,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

158
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything going to production this week or anything going to testing this week?

159
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:29,877
[SPEAKER_01]: At least wise.

160
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:31,751
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything in testing?

161
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:42,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we have anything in testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay. 

162
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:50,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you gotten any word from Battles on monitors?

163
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:58,362
[SPEAKER_01]: They may want to wait and move you guys after we get the server room moved.

164
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:04,943
[SPEAKER_01]: did they get access points put in over there?

165
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:05,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not know. I think so but don't quote me. 

166
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:09,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's walk over there.

167
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Look around.

168
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,022
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the main issue.

169
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:16,519
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't move you over there.

170
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:19,692
[SPEAKER_01]: after we knew the Wi-Fi was working,

171
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:23,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get around that wall, you don't get anything from over here.

172
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to put one over there.

173
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:29,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you guys get moved over there, I'm gonna lose my chill chair.

174
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:35,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the one that's way back there in the corner, that's next to the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah. 

175
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:39,165
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I take my breaks, I go over and sit in that chair and look out the window.

176
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:42,381
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll still be there.

177
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:44,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they'll be there.

178
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,282
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mess with them, and I don't want them to mess with me.

179
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:49,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true. It won't be an empty room anymore.

180
00:11:50,637 --> 00:11:52,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

181
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:54,336
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll find another place.

182
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:05,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'll be out Friday.

183
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan's out all week.

184
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully no big goals this week.

185
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:14,314
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ethan is, he's going to be out all week.

186
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

187
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:20,064
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the team is prepared.

188
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,260
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dustin Hodges that works with

189
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,274
[SPEAKER_00]: in accounting down there?

190
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:27,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Dustin actually does the sales stuff.

191
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:28,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

192
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,425
[SPEAKER_00]: He preached at our church this weekend.

193
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:32,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

194
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

195
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,802
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool.

196
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:36,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you from somewhere.

197
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,902
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yeah, I know you work at WW.

198
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:40,489
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the whole conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.

199
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,999
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of a, one of those

200
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:48,803
[SPEAKER_00]: coincidence sort of things.

201
00:12:49,106 --> 00:12:49,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

202
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said I'll be out Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew, yeah? 

203
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:04,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be out next week.

204
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:07,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg's out next week.

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else out coming up before...

206
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:12,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer ends?

207
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the whole DEF con thing coming up.

208
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,833
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

209
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:21,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Remind me, when is it?

210
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:23,390
[SPEAKER_03]: August.

211
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:24,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the first week of August?

212
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:26,878
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the

213
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, technically the August 1st is a Friday

214
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:33,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be like a week after that.

215
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:36,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

216
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:38,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I can send you the official dates. 

217
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're out there. I just don't have it in my brain. 

218
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:44,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like the first Tuesday

219
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:45,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

220
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:46,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

221
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:48,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Flying back that next Monday.

222
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were flying back that Sunday.

223
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:53,930
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently we're flying back that Monday.

224
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:55,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

225
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:57,967
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

226
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:02,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew, you got any facts?

227
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?

228
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:03,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

229
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:04,741
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

230
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one fact.

231
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I may have used it, but it was a while ago if I did.

232
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:14,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think this is a cool concept, but China's the only

233
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:20,203
[SPEAKER_06]: country in the world with giant pandas and they have what they call panda

234
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:24,102
[SPEAKER_06]: diplomacy, which is basically if they're on good terms with you

235
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,670
[SPEAKER_06]: they will lend you a panda to have in your zoo and if they

236
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:34,058
[SPEAKER_06]: your country does something that they do not like.

237
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:37,585
[SPEAKER_06]: they will recall the pandas and ship them back to China.

238
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:43,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently there are four in the United States in various cities.

239
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:48,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are at least 25 zoos worldwide.

240
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:51,379
[SPEAKER_06]: that have Chinese pandas.

241
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:53,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, doesn't St.

242
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Louis still have one?

243
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:54,882
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to.

244
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

245
00:14:57,952 --> 00:14:59,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think so.

246
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:02,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw on the Wikipedia page it mentioned St.

247
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Louis as one of the first zoos to have one.

248
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:11,183
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like that would be a very strong diplomatic

249
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:13,478
[SPEAKER_00]: leveraging point, you know?

250
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:18,810
[SPEAKER_00]: You better recall those tariffs and we're going to take our pandas back.

251
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:21,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

252
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:26,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's just supposed to keep it in the news.

253
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:27,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

254
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the rest of the world is not happy about something.

255
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:38,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if that like you got all these different species that live everywhere

256
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,262
[SPEAKER_01]: What's keeping other countries from

257
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,097
[SPEAKER_01]: starting their own population, though.

258
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:52,223
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a major scandal if we started...
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah we just... 

259
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,735
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding operations.

260
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:56,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, our own panda population.

261
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:58,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe China controls it.

262
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,491
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only going to send you boy pandas.

263
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:00,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

264
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:02,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I think

265
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:08,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there have been babies born in American zoos,

266
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:11,967
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think per the agreement they belong to China,

267
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:17,957
[SPEAKER_06]: so they may let us keep them, but like they can still take them back.

268
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:18,146

269
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

270
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:27,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

271
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:29,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll be a quiet week.

272
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:31,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

273
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no releases going out, so.

274
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:34,731
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

275
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:39,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, thanks guys.

276
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:40,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bible school tonight. 
[SPEAKER_00]: Hm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bible school tonight. 

277
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:53,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah?

278
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:55,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacation Bible School.

279
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:07,401
[SPEAKER_01]: They redid the school's sound system in the gym.

280
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:10,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot easier.

281
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:14,047
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't have anything.

282
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:14,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

283
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:20,158
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little small church and our gym is in the parking lot and it has a broken basketball goal.

284
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:20,300

285
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:36,963
[SPEAKER_01]: and it goes through all the speakers.

286
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:37,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

287
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:40,525
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a distribution amp, but we don't use it really.

288
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:43,277
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all these different channels on it.

289
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:48,525
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control like you can make the sound come out of wherever you want it to come out of but

290
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:52,331
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have two speakers.

291
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,870
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even know why they bought it to put it in.

292
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:57,094
[SPEAKER_00]: I think actually, I think it was all donated.

293
00:17:57,699 --> 00:17:59,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's cool.

294
00:17:59,191 --> 00:17:59,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

295
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're like, well, it's donated.

296
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and put it in.

297
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:08,645
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a while to figure that one out.

298
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:12,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, where's the sound?

299
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn this thing on.

300
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:22,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, ours is really simple.

301
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,705
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 16 channel

302
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:30,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix Master, Heath Allen, and that's pretty much the only thing you have to deal with.

303
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:35,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to turn on the amp in the back and turn on the different channels?

304
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:39,775
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need to know.

305
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:53,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many knobs for me once you hook up or connect the mics to it or whatever you plug into it, it's already built-in. 
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool. 

306
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:01,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's a lot more compact to a big mix of lines like.

307
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
