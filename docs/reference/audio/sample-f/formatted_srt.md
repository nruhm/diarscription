1 00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:15,002 SPEAKER_00:
2 00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,051 SPEAKER_02: My back didn't hurt nearly as bad until I got here.
3 00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:49,140 SPEAKER_00: this open water that I've had on my desk for probably two weeks now.
4 00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,026 SPEAKER_00: It kind of tastes like pencil shavings.
5 00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:54,637 SPEAKER_01: You drank that?
6 00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,550 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because it's just water.
7 00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,624 SPEAKER_00: It can't rot or anything.
8 00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:02,488 SPEAKER_00: It's just stale, I'll be fine.
9 00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:06,862 SPEAKER_00: It has some floating office lint in it.
10 00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:07,827 SPEAKER_02: Right.
11 00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:08,108 SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
12 00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,023 SPEAKER_03: It tastes like, at least they don't put lead in pencils anymore, right?
13 00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:14,571 SPEAKER_03: It's graphite now.
13 00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:14,571 SPEAKER_02: Mhm.
14 00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:18,638 SPEAKER_03: When I was a kid I think they actually had lead in your pencils.
15 00:01:19,428 --> 00:01:21,357 SPEAKER_03: May account for why I'm kind of crazy.
16 00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:24,713 SPEAKER_03: Because I used to chew on my pencils.
17 00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:29,218 SPEAKER_02: Who didn't you own the pencils?
18 00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:33,707 SPEAKER_00: I still have a piece of my pencil from seventh grade in my finger.
19 00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:35,121 SPEAKER_02: I got a piece right here.
20 00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:36,778 SPEAKER_00: It's like a little tattoo.
21 00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:42,263 SPEAKER_00: I just sharpened my pencil and I was twirling it.
22 00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:49,603 SPEAKER_00: and like somebody bumped me and now I've had this for like 30 years.
23 00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,915 SPEAKER_00: 20 something.
24 00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:05,749 SPEAKER_02: This is everybody, right? Conrad, Jacob?
25 00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,580 SPEAKER_05: Chris is here.
26 00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,864 SPEAKER_03: We have our own metronome now.
27 00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:12,115 SPEAKER_02: I think they're coming back tomorrow, I think. Right?
28 00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:21,075 SPEAKER_04: I heard, wait, I heard Wednesday.
29 00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:27,319 SPEAKER_02: Stevie said, I know they were going to come back today.
30 00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:30,500 SPEAKER_04: Maybe that's what it was.
31 00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:34,288 SPEAKER_04: I think Sai said, I think, that they're coming back.
32 00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:38,116 SPEAKER_04: tomorrow but they're going to be getting in late so it would probably be out Wednesday too.
33 00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,009 SPEAKER_04: Maybe that's what it was.
34 00:02:41,322 --> 00:02:43,435 SPEAKER_02: I'll find out when I sent a message.
35 00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:49,577 SPEAKER_02: Okay, quick meeting, however,
36 00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,059 SPEAKER_02: New guy starts today.
37 00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:55,615 SPEAKER_04: I saw the invite.
38 00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:57,306 SPEAKER_02: So, we'll just...
39 00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:03,229 SPEAKER_02: That one's just to kind of get our feet wet, see what his expectations are.
40 00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,195 SPEAKER_02: We'll talk about what we want to try and get out of him
41 00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:10,789 SPEAKER_02: and then start getting the wheels turned.
41 00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:10,789 SPEAKER_00: What team?
42 00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:16,324 SPEAKER_02: So he's gonna be focused on the finance team to start.
43 00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:20,357 SPEAKER_02: But it's, he's gonna be a pro, what do I call him?
44 00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:21,605 SPEAKER_02: It's product manager.
45 00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,491 SPEAKER_05: He said product manager.
46 00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:24,222 SPEAKER_02: That's right.
47 00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:27,363 SPEAKER_02: I still don't know what the difference is between product and project.
48 00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,537 SPEAKER_02: Product, I guess, is more broader...
49 00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:32,814 SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
50 00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,089 SPEAKER_02: But he's going to be kind of our...
51 00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,633 SPEAKER_02: Kind of like what I did, only a lot better.
52 00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:41,637 SPEAKER_02: Whenever I started.
53 00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:44,640 SPEAKER_02: So he's going to give us more direction on
54 00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,310 SPEAKER_02: the in between user perspective.
55 00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,415 SPEAKER_02: And us and kind of take that off our plate.
56 00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:57,685 SPEAKER_05: It's what I've always called the analysis phase of the project.
57 00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:02,022 SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
57 00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:02,022 SPEAKER_05: Taking it into like a project management room too.
58 00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:05,025 SPEAKER_02: So he'll kind of.
59 00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:08,603 SPEAKER_02: Come up with a plan, get some mock-ups drawn, get it all.
60 00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:14,593 SPEAKER_02: okayed by the users week off of that today
61 00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:16,292 SPEAKER_02: for a day.
62 00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:16,939 SPEAKER_02: That's what we're doing.
63 00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:22,643 SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he'll help with a lot of things, just...
64 00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:26,777 SPEAKER_02: process-wise, I think, and give us some more
65 00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:30,540 SPEAKER_02: feedback on what we could do better which i think is good
66 00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,005 SPEAKER_02: Uh...
67 00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:38,118 SPEAKER_02: We did have a cabin order.
68 00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,349 SPEAKER_02: Did you get all those?
69 00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:40,747 SPEAKER_06: Yeah, that's good.
70 00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:41,577 SPEAKER_02: Okay.
71 00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:47,668 SPEAKER_02: Hopefully not let anything else come through before Conrad gets back.
72 00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:50,386 SPEAKER_02: Did we have anything else go out?
73 00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:53,271 SPEAKER_04: Check Smith 1.0.0, it's out.
74 00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,292 SPEAKER_02: Nice, nice.
75 00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,500 SPEAKER_02: In production.
76 00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,741 SPEAKER_04: Yep.
77 00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:59,392 SPEAKER_04: See what Jordan thinks.
78 00:04:59,412 --> 00:04:59,795 SPEAKER_05: It's cool.
79 00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,928 SPEAKER_04: I think it looks pretty slick.
80 00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:14,282 SPEAKER_02: Okay, so he's using it, or he's going to use it.
81 00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,850 SPEAKER_04: He's going to use it, yeah.
82 00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,849 SPEAKER_04: Phase 1 went out at the beginning of July.
83 00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,730 SPEAKER_04: deposit stuff and you'll use that, seemed like it worked great so
84 00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,438 SPEAKER_04: Hopefully we have the same success with the reconciler.
85 00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:32,252 SPEAKER_02: Sweet, that's a win if all goes well.
86 00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:38,563 SPEAKER_04: I delivered like a week late, but also Matt was on sales stuff the whole time, so yeah.
87 00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:41,500 SPEAKER_02: Uh...
88 00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:48,621 SPEAKER_02: Did you have a chance to look at those...
89 00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:52,384 SPEAKER_02: those employees that dropped off the file for like
90 00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:56,569 SPEAKER_04: No, did you get like the list of those?
91 00:05:56,549 --> 00:06:02,087 SPEAKER_02: i think they were in the original or not the original but the the previous email that i had sent
92 00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,359 SPEAKER_02: where they had the results from the last time.
93 00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,234 SPEAKER_02: I think those 28 are in there, but I'll check.
94 00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:13,225 SPEAKER_02: Because yeah if we get those verified that they're not
95 00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:13,498 SPEAKER_02:
96 00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,502 SPEAKER_02: needing it anymore then I think we're good.
97 00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:20,953 SPEAKER_02: That'd be great.
98 00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,543 SPEAKER_02: The whole thing I gotta give him...
99 00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:29,931 SPEAKER_02: like an email group or...
100 00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:34,993 SPEAKER_02: a list of emails to send if there are issues, kind of like what we do with SMS.
101 00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:38,644 SPEAKER_02: So are you on those by chance?
102 00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,128 SPEAKER_02: I didn't think so.
103 00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,604 SPEAKER_02: I know it's me and April and probably Jeff too.
104 00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:47,953 SPEAKER_02: I'll just, I'll grab and see who we send SMS to and put the same thing on there.
105 00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,001 SPEAKER_02: You got that ticket this morning.
106 00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:56,948 SPEAKER_02: Did you figure that out?
107 00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:59,024 SPEAKER_06: We're still working on it.
108 00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:01,099 SPEAKER_06: They changed the IPs, yeah, so.
109 00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:07,815 SPEAKER_06: I think he's going to restart the service at nine, so we'll see how that looks then.
109 00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:07,815 SPEAKER_02: Okay.
110 00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,088 SPEAKER_02: Anything else coming out this week?
111 00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:19,408 SPEAKER_06: Well, I'm still trying to get Application Hub to consolidate.
112 00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,560 SPEAKER_02: Okay, application hub versus app hub.
113 00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,314 SPEAKER_06: Yes, they may switch and it may just be App Hub, but for right now it's going to be Application Hub.
114 00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:31,969 SPEAKER_06: to do testing and see how it works.
115 00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:34,242 SPEAKER_02: It could be.
116 00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:39,405 SPEAKER_02: Like App Hub 2 that we've had for ever for Cabinet Order.
117 00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:40,755 SPEAKER_06: Or app angular or something.
118 00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,907 SPEAKER_02: Or something.
119 00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,534 SPEAKER_02: at least accounting is accounting now, right?
120 00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:49,695 SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
121 00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,484 SPEAKER_04: We renamed it across some issues.
122 00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:52,770 SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
123 00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,306 SPEAKER_02: Alright.
124 00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:58,947 SPEAKER_02: Anything else coming up this week that you know of?
125 00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:05,854 SPEAKER_02: Uh, anything in testing right now?
126 00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,642 SPEAKER_07: No, just check smith.
127 00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:09,645 SPEAKER_07: Everything's looking good so far.
128 00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:14,758 SPEAKER_04: We might have a benefit broker we're working on that right now i don't know if we'll do like a couple of small releases or just
129 00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:15,792 SPEAKER_04: group it all into one.
130 00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,982 SPEAKER_04: There's some things that
131 00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:22,538 SPEAKER_04: has been making it more difficult for April to use.
132 00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:28,798 SPEAKER_02: Something else I want to throw in the list if it's not in there already is
133 00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:31,802 SPEAKER_02: the file transfer.
134 00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:36,004 SPEAKER_02: Like whenever they create a new file, where it actually throws it in the FTP.
135 00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:38,497 SPEAKER_02: automatically when we do SMS.
136 00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:41,995 SPEAKER_02: Just because I'm doing it right now.
136 00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:41,995 SPEAKER_04: I'm sure it's a little tedious to have to have to transfer the files every time
137 00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:51,057 SPEAKER_02: I don't mind to do it at all, if not here.
138 00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:55,393 SPEAKER_02: And it doesn't get sent out on Friday.
139 00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,500 SPEAKER_02: Need to make sure it gets out on time.
140 00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,802 SPEAKER_04: It'd be more secure, too, that way we don't have to get teams or anything involved.
140 00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,802 SPEAKER_02: Right.
141 00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:05,704 SPEAKER_05: And Fortune Foundry too.
142 00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:12,403 SPEAKER_05: a more pressing line because I think that started when you were out and then Jacob looked at stuff and then Jacob was out.
143 00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:18,681 SPEAKER_02: It's something we can talk about, maybe that's one that we could
144 00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,441 SPEAKER_02: Can we start with that one?
145 00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:22,545 SPEAKER_02: With Krishna?
146 00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:24,274 SPEAKER_02: I mean, he's got pretty much everything he needs.
147 00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:28,536 SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I had the idea from Jacob that it was basically done just waiting on like that.
148 00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:33,514 SPEAKER_05: the ACH business and
148 00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:33,514 SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
148 00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:33,514 SPEAKER_05: I found the thing and he found the
149 00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:39,032 SPEAKER_05: thing that he was looking at that he liked so i think he was gonna set up a demo
150 00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,255 SPEAKER_05: So that one might not require as much.
151 00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:46,558 SPEAKER_02: But that's something to keep in mind.
152 00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:49,647 SPEAKER_02: With Krishna going forward we can...
153 00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:56,143 SPEAKER_02: Start thinking about what we want to start with or what we want to get our feet wet with.
154 00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:59,424 SPEAKER_05: And it wouldn't have to be a finance one.
155 00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,577 SPEAKER_05: That's kind of what we went with.
156 00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:06,032 SPEAKER_05: We want to help bridge that gap between development and
157 00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:12,023 SPEAKER_05: user base and take a lot of that load off of the developers and the team leads.
158 00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:15,887 SPEAKER_05: and the analysis load and it just seemed like
159 00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:19,262 SPEAKER_05: Your team is supposed to become a painful one.
160 00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:25,152 SPEAKER_05: for like difficult users and also pulling you, pulling your time out.
161 00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,266 SPEAKER_05: So I figured that might be a good test bed.
162 00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,111 SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
163 00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:30,789 SPEAKER_04: I think so.
164 00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:30,990 SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
165 00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:32,600 SPEAKER_02: We'll discuss.
166 00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:35,209 SPEAKER_04: I'm just curious to kind of see
167 00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,293 SPEAKER_04: Like, what his opinion on, like, just...
168 00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:42,651 SPEAKER_04: like i've read a little bit about agile and scrum and stuff and to me like
169 00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:45,807 SPEAKER_04: It makes sense to me how that works, I think.
170 00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:50,397 SPEAKER_04: on like if we just had like one big
171 00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:54,413 SPEAKER_04: you know app that we work on and various pieces of it but to me it's like I
172 00:10:54,393 --> 00:11:00,403 SPEAKER_04: I find it hard to figure out how to fit that framework over where all of our teams have
173 00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:04,611 SPEAKER_04: 16 different apps that are all, you know, slightly connected, but not really.
174 00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:05,618 SPEAKER_04: It's like, how do you
175 00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:11,203 SPEAKER_04: plan sprints and stuff around, just like fixing like one little thing here, going a little bit here.
176 00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:16,527 SPEAKER_02: So we can tell them about that.
177 00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:17,110 SPEAKER_02: Because I want to accept it.
178 00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:21,835 SPEAKER_02: I think that would be that's my biggest
179 00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:28,247 SPEAKER_02: issue with what, like when he was given his
180 00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:29,255 SPEAKER_02: Interview.
181 00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,445 SPEAKER_02: On the way they do things.
182 00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:36,821 SPEAKER_02: it's all based off of one application.
183 00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:39,115 SPEAKER_02: So when you throw a hundred plus
184 00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,382 SPEAKER_02: Into the mix.
185 00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:44,262 SPEAKER_02: How do you, how do you manage that?
186 00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:50,151 SPEAKER_05: our approach made sense at one time or maybe it makes would make more sense with the
187 00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:55,467 SPEAKER_05: Teams so to consolidate things differently now, I don't know.
188 00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,445 SPEAKER_02: This will be good.
189 00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,555 SPEAKER_02: Good.
190 00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:03,633 SPEAKER_02: Good way to just throw things at him and say, hey, have you ever seen this before?
191 00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:04,478 SPEAKER_02: How would you
192 00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,448 SPEAKER_02: deal with this, go from there.
193 00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:12,612 SPEAKER_02: Yeah, today's meeting is just to get our feet wet.
194 00:12:12,592 --> 00:12:14,100 SPEAKER_02: We'll schedule more going forward.
195 00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:18,163 SPEAKER_02: I'm assuming he's going to be remote, obviously.
196 00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:21,319 SPEAKER_02: Does he know, timing-wise, how much
197 00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,526 SPEAKER_02: he's going to be available.
198 00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:26,871 SPEAKER_05: I think he's available quite a bit, but I think that we can utilize him
199 00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,845 SPEAKER_05: However we want.
199 00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,845 SPEAKER_02: Okay.
200 00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:32,999 SPEAKER_05: And I think that he had like a 40-hour capacity.
201 00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:35,275 SPEAKER_05: We just didn't... I told the...
202 00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,768 SPEAKER_05: the people that we would be thinking like a 10 to 12 maybe.
203 00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:42,042 SPEAKER_05: Just to get started and see, just to learn it.
204 00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:48,180 SPEAKER_05: But if we need more that's okay and if we need less we can flesh that out.
205 00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,623 SPEAKER_02: Okay.
206 00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:53,601 SPEAKER_05: It was the other guy we talked to that had less capacity.
207 00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:55,282 SPEAKER_05: The guy that reminded me of Kyle?
208 00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:55,565 SPEAKER_02: Yes.
209 00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:57,043 SPEAKER_02: From a different country.
210 00:12:57,023 --> 00:13:02,157 SPEAKER_02: Although Kyle is from a different country too, I guess.
211 00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,195 SPEAKER_02: Um.
212 00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:12,940 SPEAKER_02: I'm assuming we'll give him his own email and everything.
213 00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:16,262 SPEAKER_02: Just like he's here.
214 00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:16,483 SPEAKER_02: Okay.
215 00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:22,187 SPEAKER_02: So we'll set him up with a VM too, that way he has some place to connect to.
216 00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:34,258 SPEAKER_02: We'll have somebody work on that.
217 00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:34,641 SPEAKER_02: All right.
218 00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,993 SPEAKER_02: Oh, um...
219 00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:51,820 SPEAKER_02: Not everyone is here so we can't talk about the new stuff that we talked about late Thursday.
220 00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,954 SPEAKER_03: You and I will have to get together and
221 00:13:55,934 --> 00:14:01,945 SPEAKER_03: flesh out how how we want that board to look in the meetings and
221 00:13:55,934 --> 00:14:01,945 SPEAKER_02: Yup.
222 00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,927 SPEAKER_03: what we want to focus on.
223 00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:10,483 SPEAKER_02: We'll talk about that before Thursday.
224 00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:14,081 SPEAKER_02: And then the other guys that come back will just be there for the ride.
225 00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:15,307 SPEAKER_03: That'd be great.
226 00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:15,428 SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
227 00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:17,858 SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's just like...
228 00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:22,684 SPEAKER_03: You've all seen the boards, the board that we had for our meetings that we were using for a while.
229 00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:26,683 SPEAKER_03: We're just going to try and make that a little more focused.
230 00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:29,923 SPEAKER_03: It's grown in
231 00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:34,634 SPEAKER_03: I guess, scope or whatever you want to say.
232 00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:35,562 SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
233 00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:36,792 SPEAKER_03:
234 00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:40,723 SPEAKER_03: Try and narrow that down a little bit so we're not jumping around so much.
235 00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:43,120 SPEAKER_02: Yeah, still want to keep the meetings short and to the point.
236 00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,436 SPEAKER_02: But we gotta find that point.
237 00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:48,705 SPEAKER_03: Right.
238 00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,802 SPEAKER_02: Alright, Andrew, you got anything fun?
239 00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:55,350 SPEAKER_02: No downers today.
240 00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:59,691 SPEAKER_00: I don't have any downers but I also don't have anything fun.
241 00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:00,742 SPEAKER_03: That's always fun.
242 00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,792 SPEAKER_00: I have three...
243 00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,982 SPEAKER_00: vaguely ant-related facts.
244 00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:09,377 SPEAKER_00: One, I don't know if you've seen in the dirt
245 00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:13,191 SPEAKER_00: but like those little like cone things.
246 00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:17,106 SPEAKER_00: Those are ant, do you know what I'm talking about?
247 00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:21,038 SPEAKER_00: It's like in the dust or sand.
248 00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:25,122 SPEAKER_00: There will be an indentation that looks like a little cone.
249 00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:30,285 SPEAKER_00: At the bottom of that is a little thing about that big called an antlion.
249 00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:30,285 SPEAKER_03: Yes.
250 00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:36,428 SPEAKER_00: and it will basically get the ants to fall in there
251 00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,622 SPEAKER_00: and it will eat them.
252 00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:43,887 SPEAKER_00: I'm assuming that was probably the inspiration for the
253 00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:49,641 SPEAKER_00: The Star Wars thing and then the
254 00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:54,670 SPEAKER_00: in the Wrath of Khan movie, the ear thing they put in is basically like
255 00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,680 SPEAKER_00: a very large scale.
256 00:15:56,741 --> 00:15:58,952 SPEAKER_00: That's what they look like, but they're smaller.
257 00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:00,238 SPEAKER_00: They're actually like tiny.
258 00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:03,917 SPEAKER_02: So are you saying that the cones that are on the ground
259 00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:06,388 SPEAKER_02: Are not made by the ants where they are?
260 00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:06,955 SPEAKER_00: Are not.
261 00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:08,915 SPEAKER_02: They're made by antlions.
262 00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,532 SPEAKER_02: That's what I thought.
263 00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,620 SPEAKER_03: Now the cones that look like volcanoes are the ants.
264 00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,611 SPEAKER_03: yeah and the cones
264 00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,611 SPEAKER_00: The depression
264 00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,611 SPEAKER_03: The depression
264 00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,611 SPEAKER_03: are the antlions and they make these little
265 00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:23,374 SPEAKER_03: traps for the ants to go into.
266 00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:25,719 SPEAKER_03: And my brother and I used to play with those things.
267 00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,154 SPEAKER_03: We would feed them.
268 00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,657 SPEAKER_03: Just the antlion would come up out of there.
268 00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,657 SPEAKER_00: Antlion.
269 00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:31,727 SPEAKER_03: Yep.
270 00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:36,199 SPEAKER_03: Doesn't he have a little red marking or something on his back?
271 00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,961 SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure.
272 00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:38,566 SPEAKER_03: I think he does.
273 00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,705 SPEAKER_03: The ones that I looked at, the ones we had, were
274 00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:42,915 SPEAKER_03: larger than normal ants.
275 00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:50,627 SPEAKER_00: Then there are a class, I'm only aware of one of them, but I know there are multiple.
276 00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:55,842 SPEAKER_00: called ant mimics, which are things that look like ants.
277 00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:58,305 SPEAKER_00: to try and not be eaten.
278 00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:01,320 SPEAKER_00: And there's one I see every once in a while.
279 00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,942 SPEAKER_00: It's a little fly that we have in
280 00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:09,932 SPEAKER_00: Missouri, but it like walks around in its body and its wings.
281 00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:11,901 SPEAKER_00: Are kind of shaped like an ant.
282 00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,737 SPEAKER_02: That looks like tremors.
283 00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:21,205 SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
284 00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:25,632 SPEAKER_03: That does not look like the ant lion that I'm used to seeing, though.
285 00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:26,217 SPEAKER_04: Do you play Terraria?
286 00:17:26,197 --> 00:17:30,300 SPEAKER_03: Seems like I remember them being a little bigger and having a red mark on their back.
287 00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,333 SPEAKER_00: I have.
287 00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,333 SPEAKER_04: It looks like the flying monsters that attack you.
288 00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:41,117 SPEAKER_00: The last fact, this may be controversial, but I'm 99% positive.
289 00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:45,640 SPEAKER_00: that it is correct, but is fire ants aren't red.
290 00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,392 SPEAKER_00: Most people think fire ants are red.
291 00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:51,546 SPEAKER_00: Fire ants are black and cause a burning sensation.
292 00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:54,388 SPEAKER_00: And so that's why they're called fire ants.
293 00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,258 SPEAKER_02: What are the red ants?
294 00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,697 SPEAKER_00: Other ants.
295 00:17:58,363 --> 00:17:58,888 SPEAKER_00: Just ants.
296 00:17:58,908 --> 00:17:59,615 SPEAKER_00: Other ants.
297 00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:00,726 SPEAKER_03: Other kinds of ants.
298 00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:01,836 SPEAKER_00: I don't know what they're called.
299 00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:03,915 SPEAKER_00: But yeah, I...
300 00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:07,375 SPEAKER_00: That made me very mad a couple years ago when I read that.
301 00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:09,045 SPEAKER_00: My whole life was a lie.
302 00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,395 SPEAKER_00:
303 00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:14,277 SPEAKER_00: I thought they were called fire ants because they were those orange ones.
304 00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,555 SPEAKER_01: What are those big old red and black?
305 00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:22,528 SPEAKER_00: Oh, those unofficially called cow killers?
306 00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:23,559 SPEAKER_00: Um,
307 00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,784 SPEAKER_00: velvet ants, is that what you're talking about?
308 00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:29,093 SPEAKER_00: They're female
309 00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:32,957 SPEAKER_00: wingless wasps and they can sting.
310 00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:35,100 SPEAKER_00: So they're not technically ants.
311 00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:40,045 SPEAKER_00: but they're supposed to be terribly painful because they're actually wasps.
312 00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,926 SPEAKER_00: and their stinger isn't like
313 00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:48,027 SPEAKER_00: just on the end, but it's like they shoot it out
314 00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:53,190 SPEAKER_00: and it's like actually long, so it would probably hurt to be stunned by one of those.
315 00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,363 SPEAKER_03: That sounds more like what I thought those lion ants were.
315 00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,363 SPEAKER_00: And...
316 00:18:56,343 --> 00:19:00,295 SPEAKER_03: Maybe we were messing around with something we should have been messing with.
317 00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:06,285 SPEAKER_00: The female or the males actually have wings and they fly around and they look like normal wasps
318 00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:09,019 SPEAKER_00: Like, yeah, if you see something
319 00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:14,200 SPEAKER_00: I think there are blue ones, but I've only ever seen red ones walking around.
320 00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:16,107 SPEAKER_00: I don't mess with them.
321 00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,920 SPEAKER_02: It wasn't too bad.
322 00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,631 SPEAKER_02:
323 00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:28,484 SPEAKER_02: 10:30 next meeting.
324 00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:30,417 SPEAKER_02: Whoever is on.
