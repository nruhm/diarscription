WEBVTT

00:11.624 --> 00:15.002
I'm going to be in there.

00:30.170 --> 00:31.051
until I got here.

00:45.155 --> 00:49.140
[SPEAKER_00]: this open water that I've had on my desk for probably two weeks now.

00:49.120 --> 00:52.026
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of tastes like pencil shavings.

00:53.288 --> 00:54.637
[SPEAKER_00]: You drank that?

00:55.141 --> 00:56.550
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it's just water.

00:56.570 --> 00:58.624
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't rot or anything.

00:59.127 --> 01:02.488
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stay, I'll be fine.

01:03.042 --> 01:06.862
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some floating office line in it.

01:07.646 --> 01:07.827
Right.

01:08.008 --> 01:08.108
Yeah.

01:08.560 --> 01:13.023
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes like, at least they don't put lead in pencils anymore, right?

01:13.204 --> 01:14.571
[SPEAKER_08]: It's graphite now.

01:14.551 --> 01:18.638
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was a kid I think they actually had lead in your pencils.

01:19.428 --> 01:21.357
[SPEAKER_08]: May account for why I'm kind of crazy.

01:22.422 --> 01:24.713
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I used to chew on my pencils.

01:25.992 --> 01:29.218
[SPEAKER_06]: Who didn't you own the pencils?

01:29.587 --> 01:33.707
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a piece of my pencil from seventh grade in my finger.

01:33.687 --> 01:35.121
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a piece right here.

01:35.243 --> 01:36.778
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a little tattoo.

01:36.758 --> 01:42.263
[SPEAKER_00]: I just sharpened my pencil.

01:44.048 --> 01:49.603
[SPEAKER_00]: and like somebody bumped me and now I've had this for like 30 years.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.915
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 something.

02:03.438 --> 02:05.749
[SPEAKER_05]: Conrad, Jason.

02:05.790 --> 02:06.580
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris is here.

02:07.049 --> 02:09.864
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our own metronome now.

02:09.884 --> 02:12.115
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're coming back tomorrow.

02:15.082 --> 02:21.075
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard, wait, I heard Wednesday.

02:23.637 --> 02:27.319
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they were going to come today.

02:29.493 --> 02:30.500
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's what it was.

02:30.521 --> 02:34.288
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Si said, I think, that they're coming back.

02:34.268 --> 02:38.116
[SPEAKER_05]: tomorrow but they're going to be getting in late so it would probably be off Wednesday too.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.009
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's what it was.

02:41.322 --> 02:43.435
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll find out when I sent a message.

02:45.102 --> 02:49.577
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, quick meeting, however,

02:50.519 --> 02:52.059
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys start today?

02:53.017 --> 02:55.615
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all they invite.

02:55.635 --> 02:57.306
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll just...

02:57.286 --> 03:03.229
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's just to kind of get her feet wet, see what his expectations are.

03:03.209 --> 03:07.195
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about what we want to try and get out of and

03:07.175 --> 03:10.789
[SPEAKER_06]: and then start getting the wheel turned.

03:11.123 --> 03:16.324
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's gonna be focused on the finance team to start.

03:16.304 --> 03:20.357
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's, he's gonna be a pro, what do I call him?

03:20.337 --> 03:21.605
[SPEAKER_06]: It's product manager.

03:21.625 --> 03:22.491
[SPEAKER_06]: He said product manager.

03:22.652 --> 03:24.222
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

03:24.202 --> 03:27.363
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't know what the difference is between product and project.

03:27.846 --> 03:29.537
[SPEAKER_06]: Product, I guess, is more...

03:31.103 --> 03:32.814
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

03:32.834 --> 03:35.089
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's going to be kind of our...

03:35.069 --> 03:38.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like what I did, only a lot better.

03:38.613 --> 03:41.637
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever I started.

03:41.617 --> 03:44.640
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's going to give us more direction on

03:44.620 --> 03:50.310
[SPEAKER_06]: the in between the user perspective.

03:50.290 --> 03:53.415
[SPEAKER_06]: us and kind of take that off our plate.

03:53.395 --> 03:57.685
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what I've always called the analysis phase of the project.

03:57.665 --> 04:02.022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, taking it into like a project management room too.

04:02.002 --> 04:05.025
[SPEAKER_06]: So he'll know Canada.

04:05.005 --> 04:08.603
[SPEAKER_06]: Come up with a plan, get some mock-ups drawn, get it all.

04:08.583 --> 04:14.593
[SPEAKER_06]: okayed by the users week off of that today

04:14.573 --> 04:16.292
[SPEAKER_06]: for a day.

04:16.312 --> 04:16.939
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're doing.

04:19.602 --> 04:22.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he'll help with a lot of things, just...

04:22.623 --> 04:26.777
[SPEAKER_06]: process-wise, I think, and give us some more

04:26.757 --> 04:30.540
[SPEAKER_06]: feedback on what we could do better which i think is good

04:31.870 --> 04:33.005
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

04:34.587 --> 04:38.118
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have a cabin order.

04:38.159 --> 04:39.349
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get all those?

04:39.329 --> 04:40.747
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's good.

04:41.476 --> 04:41.577
Okay.

04:42.704 --> 04:47.668
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully not let anything else come through before Conrad gets back.

04:48.408 --> 04:50.386
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have anything else to go out?

04:51.011 --> 04:53.271
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack Smith 1.0.0.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, nice.

04:56.272 --> 04:57.500
[SPEAKER_05]: In production.

04:57.560 --> 04:57.741
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

04:57.762 --> 04:59.392
[SPEAKER_05]: He's what Jordan thinks.

04:59.412 --> 04:59.795
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.

04:59.815 --> 05:01.928
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it looks pretty slick.

05:10.683 --> 05:14.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so he's using it, or he's going to use it.

05:14.322 --> 05:15.850
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to use it, yeah.

05:15.830 --> 05:19.849
[SPEAKER_05]: Phase 1 went out at the beginning of July.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.730
[SPEAKER_05]: deposit stuff and you'll use that sound like it worked great so

05:23.710 --> 05:28.438
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we have the same success with the reconciler.

05:28.418 --> 05:32.252
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a win if all goes well.

05:32.772 --> 05:38.563
[SPEAKER_05]: I delivered like a week later, but also Matt was on sales stuff the whole time, so yeah.

05:39.488 --> 05:41.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

05:44.382 --> 05:48.621
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have a chance to look at those...

05:48.601 --> 05:52.384
[SPEAKER_06]: those employees that dropped off the file for like

05:52.364 --> 05:56.569
[SPEAKER_06]: No, did you get the list of those?

05:56.549 --> 06:02.087
[SPEAKER_06]: i think they were in the original or not the original but the the previous email that i had sent

06:02.067 --> 06:04.359
[SPEAKER_06]: where they had the results from the last time.

06:04.922 --> 06:07.234
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those 28 are in there, but I'll check.

06:07.214 --> 06:13.225
[SPEAKER_06]: okay yeah if we get those verified that they're not

06:13.205 --> 06:13.498
Bye.

06:14.420 --> 06:19.502
[SPEAKER_06]: needing it anymore then I think we're good.

06:19.482 --> 06:20.953
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great.

06:22.958 --> 06:25.543
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing I gotta give him...

06:26.317 --> 06:29.931
[SPEAKER_06]: like an email group or...

06:29.911 --> 06:34.993
[SPEAKER_06]: a list of emails to send if there are issues, kind of like what we do with SMS.

06:34.973 --> 06:38.644
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you on those by chance?

06:38.664 --> 06:39.128
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think so.

06:39.108 --> 06:42.604
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's me and April and probably Jeff too.

06:42.584 --> 06:47.953
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just, I'll grab and see who we send S and S to and put the same thing on there.

06:51.730 --> 06:56.001
[SPEAKER_06]: You got that ticket this morning.

06:56.021 --> 06:56.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I figure that out?

06:56.928 --> 06:59.024
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still working on it.

06:59.084 --> 07:01.099
[SPEAKER_01]: They changed the IPs, yeah, so.

07:02.058 --> 07:07.815
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's going to restart the service at nine, so we'll see how that looks at it.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.088
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else coming out this week?

07:15.473 --> 07:19.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm still trying to get Application Hub to consolidate.

07:19.810 --> 07:23.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, application hub versus app hub.

07:23.540 --> 07:29.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they may switch and it may just be App Hub, but for right now it's going to be Application Hub.

07:29.294 --> 07:31.969
[SPEAKER_02]: to do testing and see how it works.

07:32.432 --> 07:34.242
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be.

07:34.222 --> 07:39.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Like App Hub 2 that we've had for years.

07:39.385 --> 07:40.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a motor.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.907
[SPEAKER_06]: Or something.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.534
[SPEAKER_06]: at least accounting is accounting now, right?

07:49.554 --> 07:49.695
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.484
[SPEAKER_05]: We renamed it across some issues.

07:51.866 --> 07:52.770
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.306
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

07:55.282 --> 07:58.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else coming up this week that you know of?

08:02.622 --> 08:05.854
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, anything in touch here or nothing?

08:05.875 --> 08:06.642
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'll just check something.

08:06.622 --> 08:09.645
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's looking good so far.

08:09.625 --> 08:14.758
[SPEAKER_05]: a benefit broker we're working on that right now i don't know if we'll do like a couple of small releases or just

08:14.738 --> 08:15.792
[SPEAKER_05]: group it all into one.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.982
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some things that

08:18.265 --> 08:22.538
[SPEAKER_05]: has been making it more difficult for April to use.

08:22.788 --> 08:28.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else I want to throw in the list if it's not in there already is

08:28.778 --> 08:31.802
[SPEAKER_06]: the file transfer.

08:31.782 --> 08:36.004
[SPEAKER_06]: Like whenever they create a new file, where it actually throws it in the FTP.

08:35.984 --> 08:38.497
[SPEAKER_06]: automatically when we do SNS.

08:40.749 --> 08:41.995
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because...

08:45.046 --> 08:51.057
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind to do it at all, if it's not here.

08:51.037 --> 08:55.393
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't get sent out on Friday.

08:56.791 --> 08:58.500
[SPEAKER_05]: to get out on time.

08:58.520 --> 09:02.802
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be more secure, too, that way we don't have to get teams or get team help.

09:02.782 --> 09:05.704
[SPEAKER_07]: And Portion Foundry too.

09:06.443 --> 09:12.403
[SPEAKER_07]: a more pressing line because I think that started when you were out and then Jacob looked at stuff and then Jacob was out.

09:15.067 --> 09:18.681
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something we can talk about, maybe that's one that we could

09:18.661 --> 09:20.441
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we start with that one?

09:20.462 --> 09:22.545
[SPEAKER_06]: With Krishna?

09:22.525 --> 09:24.274
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he's got pretty much everything he needs.

09:24.294 --> 09:28.536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I had the idea from Jacob that it was basically done just waiting on like that.

09:28.516 --> 09:33.514
[SPEAKER_07]: the ACH business and yeah I found the thing and he found the

09:33.494 --> 09:39.032
[SPEAKER_07]: thing that he was looking at that he liked so i think he was gonna set up a demo

09:39.012 --> 09:42.255
[SPEAKER_07]: So that one might not require as much.

09:42.235 --> 09:46.558
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's something to keep in mind.

09:46.538 --> 09:49.647
[SPEAKER_06]: With Krishna going forward we can...

09:50.133 --> 09:56.143
[SPEAKER_06]: Start thinking about what we want to start with or what we want to get our feet wet with.

09:56.123 --> 09:59.424
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wouldn't have to be a finance one.

09:59.464 --> 10:01.577
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of what we went with.

10:01.557 --> 10:06.032
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to help bridge that gap between development and

10:06.012 --> 10:12.023
[SPEAKER_07]: user base and take a lot of that load off of the developers and the team leads.

10:12.003 --> 10:15.887
[SPEAKER_07]: and the analysis load and it just seemed like

10:15.867 --> 10:19.262
[SPEAKER_07]: Your team is supposed to become a painful one.

10:19.242 --> 10:25.152
[SPEAKER_07]: for difficult users and also pulling you, pulling your time out.

10:25.132 --> 10:27.266
[SPEAKER_07]: So I figured that might be a good test bed.

10:27.669 --> 10:28.111
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

10:28.132 --> 10:30.789
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

10:30.809 --> 10:30.990
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.

10:31.325 --> 10:32.600
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll discuss.

10:33.388 --> 10:35.209
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious to kind of see

10:36.269 --> 10:39.293
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what his opinion on, like, just...

10:39.273 --> 10:42.651
[SPEAKER_05]: like i've read a little bit about agile and scrum and stuff and to me like

10:42.631 --> 10:45.807
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense to me how that works, I think.

10:45.787 --> 10:50.397
[SPEAKER_05]: on like if we just had like one big

10:50.377 --> 10:54.413
[SPEAKER_05]: you know app that we work on and various pieces of it but to me it's like I

10:54.393 --> 11:00.403
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it hard to figure out how to fit that framework over where all of our teams have

11:00.383 --> 11:04.611
[SPEAKER_05]: 16 different apps that are, you know, slightly connected, but not really.

11:04.652 --> 11:05.618
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, how do you

11:05.918 --> 11:11.203
[SPEAKER_05]: playing sprints and stuff around, just like fixing like one little thing here, going a little bit here.

11:11.183 --> 11:16.527
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can tell them about that.

11:16.548 --> 11:17.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I want to accept it.

11:17.849 --> 11:21.835
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be that's my biggest

11:22.523 --> 11:28.247
[SPEAKER_06]: issue with what, like when he was given his

11:28.227 --> 11:29.255
[SPEAKER_06]: Interview.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.445
[SPEAKER_06]: The way they do things.

11:33.762 --> 11:36.821
[SPEAKER_06]: it's all based off of one application.

11:36.841 --> 11:39.115
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you throw a hundred plus

11:39.095 --> 11:40.382
[SPEAKER_06]: End of the night.

11:40.402 --> 11:44.262
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you, how do you manage that?

11:44.242 --> 11:50.151
[SPEAKER_07]: our approach made sense at one time or maybe it makes would make more sense with the

11:50.131 --> 11:55.467
[SPEAKER_07]: So to consolidate things differently now, I don't know.

11:55.447 --> 11:57.445
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be good.

11:57.930 --> 11:58.555
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

11:59.125 --> 12:03.633
[SPEAKER_06]: way to just throw things at him and say, hey, have you ever seen this before?

12:03.653 --> 12:04.478
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you

12:04.458 --> 12:07.448
[SPEAKER_06]: deal with this, go from there.

12:08.204 --> 12:12.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, today's meeting is just to get our feet wet.

12:12.592 --> 12:14.100
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to Amora going forward.

12:14.121 --> 12:18.163
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming he's going to be rote, obviously.

12:18.143 --> 12:21.319
[SPEAKER_06]: Does he know, timing-wise, how much

12:21.299 --> 12:22.526
[SPEAKER_06]: he's going to be available.

12:22.546 --> 12:26.871
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's available quite a bit, but I think that we can utilize him

12:26.851 --> 12:28.845
[SPEAKER_07]: However we want, okay?

12:30.158 --> 12:32.999
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that he had like a 40-hour capacity.

12:33.099 --> 12:35.275
[SPEAKER_07]: We just didn't... I told the...

12:35.255 --> 12:38.768
[SPEAKER_07]: the people that we would be thinking like a 10 to 12 maybe.

12:38.748 --> 12:42.042
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to get started and see, just to learn it.

12:42.663 --> 12:48.180
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we need more that's okay and if we need less we can flesh that out.

12:48.200 --> 12:48.623
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

12:48.603 --> 12:53.601
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the other guy we talked to that had less capacity.

12:53.581 --> 12:55.282
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy that reminded me of Kyle?

12:55.302 --> 12:55.565
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

12:56.497 --> 12:57.043
[SPEAKER_06]: From a different country.

12:57.023 --> 13:02.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I guess.

13:04.060 --> 13:05.195
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

13:10.827 --> 13:12.940
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming we'll give him his own email and everything.

13:13.564 --> 13:16.262
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like he's here.

13:16.382 --> 13:16.483
Okay.

13:17.459 --> 13:22.187
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll set him up with a BN2, then we just got some place to tie to.

13:30.385 --> 13:34.258
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody work on that.

13:34.278 --> 13:34.641
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

13:43.970 --> 13:46.993
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, um...

13:46.973 --> 13:51.820
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can't talk about the new stuff that we talked about late Thursday.

13:51.800 --> 13:55.954
[SPEAKER_08]: You and I will have to get together and

13:55.934 --> 14:01.945
[SPEAKER_08]: flesh out how how we want that board to look in the meetings and

14:01.925 --> 14:05.927
[SPEAKER_08]: what we want to focus on.

14:06.633 --> 14:10.483
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about that before Thursday.

14:10.463 --> 14:14.081
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other guys that come back will just be there for the ride.

14:14.624 --> 14:15.307
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be great.

14:15.328 --> 14:15.428
Yeah.

14:15.408 --> 14:17.858
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's just like...

14:18.361 --> 14:22.684
[SPEAKER_08]: You've all seen the boards, the board that we had for our meetings that we were using for a while.

14:22.985 --> 14:26.683
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just going to try and make that a little more focused.

14:27.558 --> 14:29.923
[SPEAKER_08]: It's grown and

14:32.013 --> 14:34.634
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, scope or whatever you want to say.

14:34.675 --> 14:35.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

14:36.691 --> 14:36.792
So...

14:36.772 --> 14:40.723
[SPEAKER_08]: Try and narrow that down a little bit so we're not jumping around so much.

14:41.092 --> 14:43.120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I wanna keep the meetings.

14:43.910 --> 14:47.436
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm short to the point, but we gotta find that point.

14:48.121 --> 14:48.705
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

14:50.322 --> 14:53.802
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Andrew, you got anything fun?

14:53.782 --> 14:55.350
[SPEAKER_06]: No downers today.

14:55.953 --> 14:59.691
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any downers but I also don't have anything fun.

14:59.671 --> 15:00.742
[SPEAKER_08]: That's always fun.

15:01.530 --> 15:03.792
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three...

15:03.772 --> 15:05.982
[SPEAKER_00]: vaguely ant-related facts.

15:06.886 --> 15:09.377
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I don't know if you've seen

15:09.357 --> 15:13.191
[SPEAKER_00]: but like those little like cone things.

15:13.171 --> 15:17.106
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, do you know what I'm talking about?

15:17.086 --> 15:21.038
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like in the dust or sand.

15:21.018 --> 15:25.122
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be an indentation that looks like a little cone.

15:25.102 --> 15:30.285
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom of that is a little thing about that big called an antlion.

15:30.569 --> 15:36.428
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will basically get the ants to fall in there

15:36.408 --> 15:38.622
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will eat them.

15:38.922 --> 15:43.887
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that was probably the inspiration for the

15:44.373 --> 15:49.641
[SPEAKER_00]: The Star Wars thing and then the

15:49.621 --> 15:54.670
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Wrath of Khan movie, the ear thing they put in is basically like

15:54.650 --> 15:56.680
[SPEAKER_00]: a very large scale.

15:56.741 --> 15:58.952
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they look like, but they're smaller.

15:58.972 --> 16:00.238
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually like tiny.

16:00.218 --> 16:03.917
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you saying that the cones that are on the ground

16:03.897 --> 16:06.388
[SPEAKER_06]: Are not made by the hands where they are?

16:06.408 --> 16:06.955
[SPEAKER_06]: Are not.

16:06.935 --> 16:08.915
[SPEAKER_06]: They're made by anyone else.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.532
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I thought.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.620
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the cones look like volcanoes or the ants.

16:13.600 --> 16:19.611
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah and the cones the the depression depressions are the alliance and they make these little

16:19.591 --> 16:23.374
[SPEAKER_08]: traps for the ants to go into.

16:23.354 --> 16:25.719
[SPEAKER_08]: And my brother and I used to play with those things.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.154
[SPEAKER_08]: We would feed them.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.657
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the ant land would come up out of there.

16:31.646 --> 16:31.727
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

16:32.922 --> 16:36.199
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't he have a little red marking or something on his back?

16:36.770 --> 16:37.961
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.

16:37.981 --> 16:38.566
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he does.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.705
[SPEAKER_08]: The ones that I looked at, the ones we had, were

16:41.461 --> 16:42.915
[SPEAKER_08]: larger than normal ants.

16:44.785 --> 16:50.627
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are a class, I'm only aware of one of them, but I know there are multiple.

16:50.607 --> 16:55.842
[SPEAKER_00]: called ant mimics, which are things that look like ants.

16:56.395 --> 16:58.305
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and not be eaten.

16:58.859 --> 17:01.320
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one I see every once in a while.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.942
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little fly that we have in

17:03.922 --> 17:09.932
[SPEAKER_00]: Missouri, but it like walks around in its body and its wings.

17:09.912 --> 17:11.901
[SPEAKER_00]: that are kind of shaped like an ant.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.737
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like tremors.

17:16.477 --> 17:21.205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

17:22.265 --> 17:25.632
[SPEAKER_08]: That does not look like the ant line that I'm used to seeing, though.

17:25.653 --> 17:26.217
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

17:26.197 --> 17:30.300
[SPEAKER_08]: Seems like I remember them being a little bigger and having a red mark on their back.

17:30.280 --> 17:34.333
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the flying monsters that attack you.

17:36.322 --> 17:41.117
[SPEAKER_00]: The last fact, this may be controversial, but I'm 99%.

17:41.097 --> 17:45.640
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is correct, but is fire ants aren't red.

17:45.620 --> 17:48.392
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people think fire ants are red.

17:48.412 --> 17:51.546
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire ants are black and cause a burning sensation.

17:51.998 --> 17:54.388
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why they're called fire ants.

17:54.408 --> 17:55.258
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the red ants?

17:56.909 --> 17:57.697
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ants.

17:58.363 --> 17:58.888
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ants.

17:58.908 --> 17:59.615
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ants.

17:59.999 --> 18:00.726
[SPEAKER_00]: Other kinds of ants.

18:00.706 --> 18:01.836
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're called.

18:02.058 --> 18:03.915
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I...

18:03.895 --> 18:07.375
[SPEAKER_00]: That made me very mad a couple years ago when I read that.

18:07.476 --> 18:09.045
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole life was a lie.

18:09.025 --> 18:10.395
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

18:11.152 --> 18:14.277
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they were called fire ants because they were those orange ones.

18:14.519 --> 18:16.555
[SPEAKER_03]: What are those big old red and black?

18:17.311 --> 18:22.528
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, those unofficially called cow killers?

18:22.981 --> 18:23.559
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

18:23.977 --> 18:27.784
[SPEAKER_00]: velvet ants, is that what you're talking about?

18:27.804 --> 18:29.093
[SPEAKER_00]: They're female

18:29.073 --> 18:32.957
[SPEAKER_00]: wingless wasps and they can sting.

18:33.157 --> 18:35.100
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not technically ants.

18:35.384 --> 18:40.045
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're supposed to be terribly painful because they're actually wasps.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.926
[SPEAKER_00]: and their stinger isn't like

18:45.003 --> 18:48.027
[SPEAKER_00]: just on the end, but it's like they shoot it

18:48.007 --> 18:53.190
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like actually long, so it would probably hurt to be stunned by one of those.

18:53.170 --> 18:56.363
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds more like what I thought those lion ants were.

18:56.343 --> 19:00.295
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we were messing around with something we should have been messing with.

19:00.275 --> 19:06.285
[SPEAKER_00]: The female or the males actually have wings and they fly around and they look like normal

19:06.265 --> 19:09.019
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, if you see something

19:09.387 --> 19:14.200
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are blue ones, but I've only ever seen red ones walking around.

19:14.635 --> 19:16.107
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't miss.

19:22.010 --> 19:23.920
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't too bad.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.631
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

19:26.652 --> 19:28.484
[SPEAKER_06]: 10.30 next meeting.

19:29.672 --> 19:30.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever is on.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.538
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll bring everybody else in eventually.

19:34.261 --> 19:35.812
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to overwhelm him.

19:35.993 --> 19:37.685
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a remote employee?

19:37.826 --> 19:38.652
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

19:39.172 --> 19:41.167
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's based out of Texas.

19:42.456 --> 19:44.592
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what his resume always said.

19:44.723 --> 19:46.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Where was the other guy based out of in the other country?

19:47.259 --> 19:48.104
[SPEAKER_07]: New York.

19:48.124 --> 19:48.567
[SPEAKER_07]: New York?

19:48.587 --> 19:49.975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, poor Kyle's from New York.

19:50.528 --> 19:53.449
[SPEAKER_08]: Boren Kyle is from New York, but he's not in another country.

19:53.470 --> 19:54.497
[SPEAKER_07]: He has the opposite of what

19:54.477 --> 19:55.765
[SPEAKER_07]: Our U.S.

19:55.806 --> 19:56.389
[SPEAKER_07]: Kyle does.

19:56.409 --> 19:56.691
[SPEAKER_07]: U.S.

19:56.711 --> 19:57.959
[SPEAKER_07]: Kyle goes to foreign countries.

19:57.980 --> 19:59.610
[SPEAKER_07]: Foreign Kyle comes to the U.S.

19:59.590 --> 20:00.600
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.002
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

20:03.185 --> 20:05.197
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard from Kyle?

20:05.257 --> 20:05.659
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard from Kyle?

20:05.679 --> 20:05.760
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

20:06.524 --> 20:08.757
[SPEAKER_00]: Last I heard, he lives in

20:09.395 --> 20:14.460
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives roughly 100% of his time in Puerto Rico.

20:14.677 --> 20:17.937
[SPEAKER_00]: He was coming back every once in a while because

20:18.288 --> 20:24.045
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a house that they were trying to sell in Florida and then he has parents in

20:24.802 --> 20:26.492
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Carolina, I think.

20:31.585 --> 20:32.674
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, guys.

20:32.694 --> 20:34.165
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the 28th.

20:34.206 --> 20:35.496
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the last Thursday.

20:35.516 --> 20:36.786
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when we're going to have our food day.

20:36.766 --> 20:37.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice week.

20:37.992 --> 20:40.364
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to get Ronnie Smack Fire.

20:40.444 --> 20:40.886
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

20:41.228 --> 20:42.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was good.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.900
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not object.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.990
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I had on Saturday?

20:47.090 --> 20:48.075
[SPEAKER_06]: A shrimp boil.

20:48.055 --> 20:51.923
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really good actually.

20:52.662 --> 20:57.002
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the only thing close to a shrimp will...

20:56.982 --> 21:02.385
[SPEAKER_08]: that I enjoyed more maybe, I don't know, it's a close tie, is crawfish.

21:02.551 --> 21:08.275
[SPEAKER_06]: The boil that we had was at a restaurant and you could pick what kind of seafood you wanted in it.

21:08.255 --> 21:13.506
[SPEAKER_06]: You can put clams or... The crab shack.

21:14.633 --> 21:15.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe's.

21:15.595 --> 21:16.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe's Crab Shack.

21:16.299 --> 21:17.203
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe's Crab Shack?

21:17.223 --> 21:17.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

21:17.806 --> 21:21.606
[SPEAKER_03]: The one we went to was a Cajun Crab House, I think it was.

21:21.586 --> 21:21.687
you

21:32.487 --> 21:34.633
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to say,

21:46.831 --> 21:47.493
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.
