11624	15002	I'm going to be in there.
30170	31051	until I got here.
45155	49140	this open water that I've had on my desk for probably two weeks now.
49120	52026	It kind of tastes like pencil shavings.
53288	54637	You drank that?
55141	56550	Yeah, because it's just water.
56570	58624	It can't rot or anything.
59127	62488	Just stay, I'll be fine.
63042	66862	It has some floating office line in it.
67646	67827	Right.
68008	68108	Yeah.
68560	73023	It tastes like, at least they don't put lead in pencils anymore, right?
73204	74571	It's graphite now.
74551	78638	When I was a kid I think they actually had lead in your pencils.
79428	81357	May account for why I'm kind of crazy.
82422	84713	Because I used to chew on my pencils.
85992	89218	Who didn't you own the pencils?
89587	93707	I still have a piece of my pencil from seventh grade in my finger.
93687	95121	I got a piece right here.
95243	96778	It's like a little tattoo.
96758	102263	I just sharpened my pencil.
104048	109603	and like somebody bumped me and now I've had this for like 30 years.
109583	111915	20 something.
123438	125749	Conrad, Jason.
125790	126580	Chris is here.
127049	129864	We have our own metronome now.
129884	132115	I think they're coming back tomorrow.
135082	141075	I heard, wait, I heard Wednesday.
143637	147319	I know they were going to come today.
149493	150500	Maybe that's what it was.
150521	154288	I think Si said, I think, that they're coming back.
154268	158116	tomorrow but they're going to be getting in late so it would probably be off Wednesday too.
158680	160009	Maybe that's what it was.
161322	163435	I'll find out when I sent a message.
165102	169577	Okay, quick meeting, however,
170519	172059	You guys start today?
173017	175615	That's all they invite.
175635	177306	So, we'll just...
177286	183229	That one's just to kind of get her feet wet, see what his expectations are.
183209	187195	We'll talk about what we want to try and get out of and
187175	190789	and then start getting the wheel turned.
191123	196324	So he's gonna be focused on the finance team to start.
196304	200357	But it's, he's gonna be a pro, what do I call him?
200337	201605	It's product manager.
201625	202491	He said product manager.
202652	204222	That's right.
204202	207363	I still don't know what the difference is between product and project.
207846	209537	Product, I guess, is more...
211103	212814	I don't know.
212834	215089	But he's going to be kind of our...
215069	218633	Kind of like what I did, only a lot better.
218613	221637	Whenever I started.
221617	224640	So he's going to give us more direction on
224620	230310	the in between the user perspective.
230290	233415	us and kind of take that off our plate.
233395	237685	It's what I've always called the analysis phase of the project.
237665	242022	Yeah, taking it into like a project management room too.
242002	245025	So he'll know Canada.
245005	248603	Come up with a plan, get some mock-ups drawn, get it all.
248583	254593	okayed by the users week off of that today
254573	256292	for a day.
256312	256939	That's what we're doing.
259602	262643	Yeah, he'll help with a lot of things, just...
262623	266777	process-wise, I think, and give us some more
266757	270540	feedback on what we could do better which i think is good
271870	273005	Uh...
274587	278118	We did have a cabin order.
278159	279349	Did you get all those?
279329	280747	Yeah, that's good.
281476	281577	Okay.
282704	287668	Hopefully not let anything else come through before Conrad gets back.
288408	290386	Do we have anything else to go out?
291011	293271	Jack Smith 1.0.0.
293251	296292	Nice, nice.
296272	297500	In production.
297560	297741	Yep.
297762	299392	He's what Jordan thinks.
299412	299795	It's cool.
299815	301928	I think it looks pretty slick.
310683	314282	Okay, so he's using it, or he's going to use it.
314322	315850	He's going to use it, yeah.
315830	319849	Phase 1 went out at the beginning of July.
320200	323730	deposit stuff and you'll use that sound like it worked great so
323710	328438	Hopefully we have the same success with the reconciler.
328418	332252	That's a win if all goes well.
332772	338563	I delivered like a week later, but also Matt was on sales stuff the whole time, so yeah.
339488	341500	Uh...
344382	348621	Did you have a chance to look at those...
348601	352384	those employees that dropped off the file for like
352364	356569	No, did you get the list of those?
356549	362087	i think they were in the original or not the original but the the previous email that i had sent
362067	364359	where they had the results from the last time.
364922	367234	I think those 28 are in there, but I'll check.
367214	373225	okay yeah if we get those verified that they're not
373205	373498	Bye.
374420	379502	needing it anymore then I think we're good.
379482	380953	That'd be great.
382958	385543	The whole thing I gotta give him...
386317	389931	like an email group or...
389911	394993	a list of emails to send if there are issues, kind of like what we do with SMS.
394973	398644	So are you on those by chance?
398664	399128	I didn't think so.
399108	402604	I know it's me and April and probably Jeff too.
402584	407953	I'll just, I'll grab and see who we send S and S to and put the same thing on there.
411730	416001	You got that ticket this morning.
416021	416948	Did I figure that out?
416928	419024	We're still working on it.
419084	421099	They changed the IPs, yeah, so.
422058	427815	I think he's going to restart the service at nine, so we'll see how that looks at it.
432200	435088	Anything else coming out this week?
435473	439408	Well, I'm still trying to get Application Hub to consolidate.
439810	443560	Okay, application hub versus app hub.
443540	449314	Yes, they may switch and it may just be App Hub, but for right now it's going to be Application Hub.
449294	451969	to do testing and see how it works.
452432	454242	It could be.
454222	459405	Like App Hub 2 that we've had for years.
459385	460755	Or a motor.
461662	464907	Or something.
466760	469534	at least accounting is accounting now, right?
469554	469695	Yeah.
469735	471484	We renamed it across some issues.
471866	472770	Yeah.
472750	474306	I know.
475282	478947	Anything else coming up this week that you know of?
482622	485854	Uh, anything in touch here or nothing?
485875	486642	No, I'll just check something.
486622	489645	Everything's looking good so far.
489625	494758	a benefit broker we're working on that right now i don't know if we'll do like a couple of small releases or just
494738	495792	group it all into one.
496320	497982	There's some things that
498265	502538	has been making it more difficult for April to use.
502788	508798	Something else I want to throw in the list if it's not in there already is
508778	511802	the file transfer.
511782	516004	Like whenever they create a new file, where it actually throws it in the FTP.
515984	518497	automatically when we do SNS.
520749	521995	Just because...
525046	531057	I don't mind to do it at all, if it's not here.
531037	535393	And it doesn't get sent out on Friday.
536791	538500	to get out on time.
538520	542802	It'd be more secure, too, that way we don't have to get teams or get team help.
542782	545704	And Portion Foundry too.
546443	552403	a more pressing line because I think that started when you were out and then Jacob looked at stuff and then Jacob was out.
555067	558681	It's something we can talk about, maybe that's one that we could
558661	560441	Can we start with that one?
560462	562545	With Krishna?
562525	564274	I mean, he's got pretty much everything he needs.
564294	568536	Yeah, I had the idea from Jacob that it was basically done just waiting on like that.
568516	573514	the ACH business and yeah I found the thing and he found the
573494	579032	thing that he was looking at that he liked so i think he was gonna set up a demo
579012	582255	So that one might not require as much.
582235	586558	But that's something to keep in mind.
586538	589647	With Krishna going forward we can...
590133	596143	Start thinking about what we want to start with or what we want to get our feet wet with.
596123	599424	And it wouldn't have to be a finance one.
599464	601577	That's kind of what we went with.
601557	606032	We want to help bridge that gap between development and
606012	612023	user base and take a lot of that load off of the developers and the team leads.
612003	615887	and the analysis load and it just seemed like
615867	619262	Your team is supposed to become a painful one.
619242	625152	for difficult users and also pulling you, pulling your time out.
625132	627266	So I figured that might be a good test bed.
627669	628111	Yeah.
628132	630789	I think so.
630809	630990	You know.
631325	632600	We'll discuss.
633388	635209	I'm just curious to kind of see
636269	639293	Like, what his opinion on, like, just...
639273	642651	like i've read a little bit about agile and scrum and stuff and to me like
642631	645807	It makes sense to me how that works, I think.
645787	650397	on like if we just had like one big
650377	654413	you know app that we work on and various pieces of it but to me it's like I
654393	660403	I find it hard to figure out how to fit that framework over where all of our teams have
660383	664611	16 different apps that are, you know, slightly connected, but not really.
664652	665618	It's like, how do you
665918	671203	playing sprints and stuff around, just like fixing like one little thing here, going a little bit here.
671183	676527	So we can tell them about that.
676548	677110	Because I want to accept it.
677849	681835	I think that would be that's my biggest
682523	688247	issue with what, like when he was given his
688227	689255	Interview.
691108	693445	The way they do things.
693762	696821	it's all based off of one application.
696841	699115	So when you throw a hundred plus
699095	700382	End of the night.
700402	704262	How do you, how do you manage that?
704242	710151	our approach made sense at one time or maybe it makes would make more sense with the
710131	715467	So to consolidate things differently now, I don't know.
715447	717445	This will be good.
717930	718555	Good.
719125	723633	way to just throw things at him and say, hey, have you ever seen this before?
723653	724478	How would you
724458	727448	deal with this, go from there.
728204	732612	Yeah, today's meeting is just to get our feet wet.
732592	734100	We'll get to Amora going forward.
734121	738163	I'm assuming he's going to be rote, obviously.
738143	741319	Does he know, timing-wise, how much
741299	742526	he's going to be available.
742546	746871	I think he's available quite a bit, but I think that we can utilize him
746851	748845	However we want, okay?
750158	752999	And I think that he had like a 40-hour capacity.
753099	755275	We just didn't... I told the...
755255	758768	the people that we would be thinking like a 10 to 12 maybe.
758748	762042	Just to get started and see, just to learn it.
762663	768180	But if we need more that's okay and if we need less we can flesh that out.
768200	768623	Okay.
768603	773601	It was the other guy we talked to that had less capacity.
773581	775282	The guy that reminded me of Kyle?
775302	775565	Yes.
776497	777043	From a different country.
777023	782157	Yeah I guess.
784060	785195	Hello.
790827	792940	I'm assuming we'll give him his own email and everything.
793564	796262	Just like he's here.
796382	796483	Okay.
797459	802187	So we'll set him up with a BN2, then we just got some place to tie to.
810385	814258	Somebody work on that.
814278	814641	All right.
823970	826993	Oh, um...
826973	831820	So we can't talk about the new stuff that we talked about late Thursday.
831800	835954	You and I will have to get together and
835934	841945	flesh out how how we want that board to look in the meetings and
841925	845927	what we want to focus on.
846633	850483	We'll talk about that before Thursday.
850463	854081	And then the other guys that come back will just be there for the ride.
854624	855307	That'd be great.
855328	855428	Yeah.
855408	857858	Yeah, that's just like...
858361	862684	You've all seen the boards, the board that we had for our meetings that we were using for a while.
862985	866683	We're just going to try and make that a little more focused.
867558	869923	It's grown and
872013	874634	I guess, scope or whatever you want to say.
874675	875562	Yeah.
876691	876792	So...
876772	880723	Try and narrow that down a little bit so we're not jumping around so much.
881092	883120	Yeah, so I wanna keep the meetings.
883910	887436	I'm short to the point, but we gotta find that point.
888121	888705	Right.
890322	893802	Alright, Andrew, you got anything fun?
893782	895350	No downers today.
895953	899691	I don't have any downers but I also don't have anything fun.
899671	900742	That's always fun.
901530	903792	I have three...
903772	905982	vaguely ant-related facts.
906886	909377	One, I don't know if you've seen
909357	913191	but like those little like cone things.
913171	917106	Those are, do you know what I'm talking about?
917086	921038	It's like in the dust or sand.
921018	925122	There will be an indentation that looks like a little cone.
925102	930285	At the bottom of that is a little thing about that big called an antlion.
930569	936428	and it will basically get the ants to fall in there
936408	938622	and it will eat them.
938922	943887	I'm assuming that was probably the inspiration for the
944373	949641	The Star Wars thing and then the
949621	954670	in the Wrath of Khan movie, the ear thing they put in is basically like
954650	956680	a very large scale.
956741	958952	That's what they look like, but they're smaller.
958972	960238	They're actually like tiny.
960218	963917	So are you saying that the cones that are on the ground
963897	966388	Are not made by the hands where they are?
966408	966955	Are not.
966935	968915	They're made by anyone else.
969320	970532	That's what I thought.
970512	973620	Now the cones look like volcanoes or the ants.
973600	979611	yeah and the cones the the depression depressions are the alliance and they make these little
979591	983374	traps for the ants to go into.
983354	985719	And my brother and I used to play with those things.
985840	987154	We would feed them.
987387	990657	Just the ant land would come up out of there.
991646	991727	Yep.
992922	996199	Doesn't he have a little red marking or something on his back?
996770	997961	I'm not sure.
997981	998566	I think he does.
998606	1000705	The ones that I looked at, the ones we had, were
1001461	1002915	larger than normal ants.
1004785	1010627	Then there are a class, I'm only aware of one of them, but I know there are multiple.
1010607	1015842	called ant mimics, which are things that look like ants.
1016395	1018305	to try and not be eaten.
1018859	1021320	And there's one I see every once in a while.
1021360	1023942	It's a little fly that we have in
1023922	1029932	Missouri, but it like walks around in its body and its wings.
1029912	1031901	that are kind of shaped like an ant.
1033206	1035737	That looks like tremors.
1036477	1041205	Yeah.
1042265	1045632	That does not look like the ant line that I'm used to seeing, though.
1045653	1046217	I don't remember.
1046197	1050300	Seems like I remember them being a little bigger and having a red mark on their back.
1050280	1054333	It looks like the flying monsters that attack you.
1056322	1061117	The last fact, this may be controversial, but I'm 99%.
1061097	1065640	that it is correct, but is fire ants aren't red.
1065620	1068392	Most people think fire ants are red.
1068412	1071546	Fire ants are black and cause a burning sensation.
1071998	1074388	And so that's why they're called fire ants.
1074408	1075258	What are the red ants?
1076909	1077697	Other ants.
1078363	1078888	Just ants.
1078908	1079615	Other ants.
1079999	1080726	Other kinds of ants.
1080706	1081836	I don't know what they're called.
1082058	1083915	But yeah, I...
1083895	1087375	That made me very mad a couple years ago when I read that.
1087476	1089045	My whole life was a lie.
1089025	1090395	Thank you.
1091152	1094277	I thought they were called fire ants because they were those orange ones.
1094519	1096555	What are those big old red and black?
1097311	1102528	Oh, those unofficially called cow killers?
1102981	1103559	Um,
1103977	1107784	velvet ants, is that what you're talking about?
1107804	1109093	They're female
1109073	1112957	wingless wasps and they can sting.
1113157	1115100	So they're not technically ants.
1115384	1120045	but they're supposed to be terribly painful because they're actually wasps.
1120480	1123926	and their stinger isn't like
1125003	1128027	just on the end, but it's like they shoot it
1128007	1133190	and it's like actually long, so it would probably hurt to be stunned by one of those.
1133170	1136363	That sounds more like what I thought those lion ants were.
1136343	1140295	Maybe we were messing around with something we should have been messing with.
1140275	1146285	The female or the males actually have wings and they fly around and they look like normal
1146265	1149019	Like, yeah, if you see something
1149387	1154200	I think there are blue ones, but I've only ever seen red ones walking around.
1154635	1156107	I don't miss.
1162010	1163920	It wasn't too bad.
1165081	1166631	Okay.
1166652	1168484	10.30 next meeting.
1169672	1170417	Whoever is on.
1171375	1173538	We'll bring everybody else in eventually.
1174261	1175812	We don't want to overwhelm him.
1175993	1177685	Is this a remote employee?
1177826	1178652	Yes.
1179172	1181167	I think he's based out of Texas.
1182456	1184592	That's what his resume always said.
1184723	1186957	Where was the other guy based out of in the other country?
1187259	1188104	New York.
1188124	1188567	New York?
1188587	1189975	Yeah, poor Kyle's from New York.
1190528	1193449	Boren Kyle is from New York, but he's not in another country.
1193470	1194497	He has the opposite of what
1194477	1195765	Our U.S.
1195806	1196389	Kyle does.
1196409	1196691	U.S.
1196711	1197959	Kyle goes to foreign countries.
1197980	1199610	Foreign Kyle comes to the U.S.
1199590	1200600	Yeah.
1200741	1203002	Yeah.
1203185	1205197	Have you heard from Kyle?
1205257	1205659	You heard from Kyle?
1205679	1205760	No.
1206524	1208757	Last I heard, he lives in
1209395	1214460	He lives roughly 100% of his time in Puerto Rico.
1214677	1217937	He was coming back every once in a while because
1218288	1224045	They had a house that they were trying to sell in Florida and then he has parents in
1224802	1226492	That's Carolina, I think.
1231585	1232674	Thanks, guys.
1232694	1234165	Oh, the 28th.
1234206	1235496	I think that's the last Thursday.
1235516	1236786	That's when we're going to have our food day.
1236766	1237972	Oh, nice week.
1237992	1240364	I think we're going to get Ronnie Smack Fire.
1240444	1240886	That's good.
1241228	1242253	Yeah, it was good.
1242790	1244900	Do not object.
1244920	1246990	You know what I had on Saturday?
1247090	1248075	A shrimp boil.
1248055	1251923	It was really good actually.
1252662	1257002	I think the only thing close to a shrimp will...
1256982	1262385	that I enjoyed more maybe, I don't know, it's a close tie, is crawfish.
1262551	1268275	The boil that we had was at a restaurant and you could pick what kind of seafood you wanted in it.
1268255	1273506	You can put clams or... The crab shack.
1274633	1275397	Joe's.
1275595	1276279	Joe's Crab Shack.
1276299	1277203	Joe's Crab Shack?
1277223	1277545	Yeah.
1277806	1281606	The one we went to was a Cajun Crab House, I think it was.
1281586	1281687	you
1292487	1294633	And I'm just going to say,
1306831	1307493	Probably.
