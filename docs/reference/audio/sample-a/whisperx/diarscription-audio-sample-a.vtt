00:00.537 --> 00:06.312
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there was something that caused it to not go down far enough.

00:06.983 --> 00:11.169
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually, there's some kind of situation.

00:11.793 --> 00:12.960
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a push pull.

00:12.940 --> 00:15.828
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a push bar comes down just like a pulling out.

00:16.030 --> 00:16.656
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

00:16.636 --> 00:20.250
[SPEAKER_00]: But that push bar is something that tripped the machine.

00:20.230 --> 00:24.537
[SPEAKER_00]: to where it wasn't all the way flush.

00:25.816 --> 00:27.686
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't remember what cause.

00:28.330 --> 00:31.708
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very rare, but some cause.

00:32.228 --> 00:34.721
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some scrap or something could have been in the way.

00:34.841 --> 00:38.138
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it floated over, the push bar floated over.

00:38.506 --> 00:42.154
[SPEAKER_00]: and pull the other sheet on top of it.

00:42.134 --> 00:44.753
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was two sheets, two sheets.

00:45.176 --> 00:47.976
[SPEAKER_00]: And the operator was not there.

00:49.323 --> 00:55.249
[SPEAKER_00]: It was break time, but he was the one supposed to be on it, and he was in the bathroom.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.417
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they let him run?

00:56.457 --> 00:58.894
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happened?

00:58.874 --> 01:04.885
[SPEAKER_00]: It started to cut the next program with an inch and a half of material on the table.

01:04.865 --> 01:09.019
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was burying the collet.

01:09.286 --> 01:15.212
[SPEAKER_00]: the spindle head and just pulling like catching things on fire.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.106
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound good

01:20.626 --> 01:26.029
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, we don't need an evac system, let's just walk out of the building.

01:26.009 --> 01:27.419
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that.

01:27.439 --> 01:31.227
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting there like... I was like...

01:31.493 --> 01:34.013
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are all those people walking outside?

01:34.053 --> 01:36.492
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the office people are just dying of fire.

01:37.147 --> 01:42.077
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause ain't no one trippin' before I mark two to people who haven't had enough.

01:42.344 --> 01:45.841
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only time that I remember that we ever really needed it.

01:46.043 --> 01:46.144
Yeah.

01:51.980 --> 01:52.356
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
