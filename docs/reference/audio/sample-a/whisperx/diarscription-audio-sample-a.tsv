537	6312	Okay, so there was something that caused it to not go down far enough.
6983	11169	to actually, there's some kind of situation.
11793	12960	It's a push pull.
12940	15828	So like a push bar comes down just like a pulling out.
16030	16656	Yeah.
16636	20250	But that push bar is something that tripped the machine.
20230	24537	to where it wasn't all the way flush.
25816	27686	And I don't remember what cause.
28330	31708	It's very, very rare, but some cause.
32228	34721	Just some scrap or something could have been in the way.
34841	38138	Well it floated over, the push bar floated over.
38506	42154	and pull the other sheet on top of it.
42134	44753	So there was two sheets, two sheets.
45176	47976	And the operator was not there.
49323	55249	It was break time, but he was the one supposed to be on it, and he was in the bathroom.
55229	56417	Do they let him run?
56457	58894	And then what happened?
58874	64885	It started to cut the next program with an inch and a half of material on the table.
64865	69019	So it was burying the collet.
69286	75212	the spindle head and just pulling like catching things on fire.
76660	80106	It doesn't sound good
80626	86029	And they were like, we don't need an evac system, let's just walk out of the building.
86009	87419	I'll never forget that.
87439	91227	I was sitting there like... I was like...
91493	94013	Where are all those people walking outside?
94053	96492	I guess the office people are just dying of fire.
97147	102077	Cause ain't no one trippin' before I mark two to people who haven't had enough.
102344	105841	That's the only time that I remember that we ever really needed it.
106043	106144	Yeah.
111980	112356	Yeah.
