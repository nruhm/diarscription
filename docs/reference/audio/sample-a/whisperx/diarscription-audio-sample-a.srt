1
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:06,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there was something that caused it to not go down far enough.

2
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:11,169
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually, there's some kind of situation.

3
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:12,960
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a push pull.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a push bar comes down just like a pulling out.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

6
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:20,250
[SPEAKER_00]: But that push bar is something that tripped the machine.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,537
[SPEAKER_00]: to where it wasn't all the way flush.

8
00:00:25,816 --> 00:00:27,686
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't remember what cause.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,708
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very rare, but some cause.

10
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some scrap or something could have been in the way.

11
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:38,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it floated over, the push bar floated over.

12
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:42,154
[SPEAKER_00]: and pull the other sheet on top of it.

13
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:44,753
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was two sheets, two sheets.

14
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:47,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And the operator was not there.

15
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:55,249
[SPEAKER_00]: It was break time, but he was the one supposed to be on it, and he was in the bathroom.

16
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they let him run?

17
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,894
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happened?

18
00:00:58,874 --> 00:01:04,885
[SPEAKER_00]: It started to cut the next program with an inch and a half of material on the table.

19
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:09,019
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was burying the collet.

20
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:15,212
[SPEAKER_00]: the spindle head and just pulling like catching things on fire.

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,106
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound good

22
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:26,029
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, we don't need an evac system, let's just walk out of the building.

23
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,419
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that.

24
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting there like... I was like...

25
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:34,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are all those people walking outside?

26
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the office people are just dying of fire.

27
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:42,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause ain't no one trippin' before I mark two to people who haven't had enough.

28
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:45,841
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only time that I remember that we ever really needed it.

29
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:46,144
Yeah.

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
