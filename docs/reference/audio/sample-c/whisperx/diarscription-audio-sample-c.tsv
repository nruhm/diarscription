14527	15273	He's saying...
15877	20824	We were the home team, so if they would score, we'd have to score and come back.
20804	26798	And I was like in my mind, I'm like, I really don't want to keep playing.
26778	31017	And they kept tying it up.
30997	34595	We'd come back and tie it up and play another inning.
34615	36906	I thought you were going to have to go to the bullpen.
36886	38095	Yeah.
38115	39646	Will you guys please allude?
39666	41600	Yeah.
41620	42829	Throw the fingers.
42809	48567	You're throwing to your own team, so.
49812	54186	so that I actually did strike out the last girl.
54166	60177	I was like, okay.
60157	66167	Which the other team had scored like four runs at the top of the inning, so it was going to be hard for us to catch anyway.
66147	71145	But yeah, it was a long, long day.
73707	74030	Hello.
76796	76917	Hello.
76938	77220	Hello.
77960	79768	I think this is it for today.
81183	87193	this evening back Wednesday Greg's out and CK is
87173	90889	at that, at the moment.
92371	93758	Doesn't go to a normal doctor?
94884	97538	No, it's cheaper.
97518	100416	He has a cat named Kat.
100476	102448	A cat named Kat.
102428	105752	Every time I go, it's so expensive.
105772	106820	The doctor or the vet?
106901	107646	The vet.
107626	109436	Maybe he has vet insurance.
110642	113417	I do need to make Mabel an appointment.
113397	115890	Maybe this week sometime.
115910	119408	I do need to make Mabel an appointment for this week sometime.
119388	123222	Yeah, what do you do with her when you leave?
123556	129415	Like once a week we'll take her to daycare and that seems to pretty well wipe her out.
129395	131124	for the rest of the week.
131144	131767	That's nice.
132129	134119	Other than that, she just stays in her saloon.
134139	134983	Gotcha.
136904	138386	Does it have a dog door on it?
138873	139928	No.
139908	142637	usually sleeps long enough that she doesn't go to the bathroom.
143162	143910	Really?
143890	145620	and the dog likes to sleep.
145640	146123	That's crazy.
146646	146907	Yeah.
147611	148838	My friends, like,
148818	152374	I have a basset, too, and I feel like the thing's always peeing.
152535	154423	They have to leave all the time.
154403	156074	I gotta go let the dog out.
156276	159840	A lot of times it's gonna work like in the morning
159820	164080	go home with lunch and take her out.
164100	165426	I think it was
166722	170413	whatever day that was, I worked from home last week.
170433	170877	It was like,
171633	174201	2.15 before she actually got out of bed.
175075	179196	She never got up in the morning to go to the bathroom.
179176	185187	Like we went to bed like 9 or 10 o'clock the night before she slept until 2.15
185167	189591	I'm sure that he doesn't want to go out there either.
189571	195430	she kind of likes she'll like go sit out in the backyard and just like bask in the sun for like 15 minutes
195410	201218	and then come back in all hot and go back to sleep.
201738	204031	You gotta park cat fast and hound.
204172	207411	It gives them a different meaning to the term, it's a dog's life.
207391	208558	Yeah.
210580	213958	She was freaking out the other day with her mess up the piece, too.
215103	218616	Just, I want to leave him outside too.
219575	223595	He died bombing her instead of the air conditioner.
223615	225585	Yeah, I didn't let her out.
225565	225616	you
227675	232538	Alright, this will be a quick one, I'm sure.
232518	233821	The...
234948	236683	Do you have any releases?
237046	239406	We'll get a cabinet order I think we're in.
239386	245211	I've got...
246642	251353	I think we're finally done with the formatting of the
251333	255133	the Lincoln file for Ethan's side.
255113	259251	The main thing we gotta get fixed now
259231	264128	NSYNC is the data because we don't know what they have loaded.
264108	268600	What we have is the truth, but we don't know what they have.
268580	272059	get it all back in sync and they don't seem to understand
272039	276008	Like we could just take our data and use it.
275988	279788	I just have to make sure it's in sync with what they have.
280763	283433	We'll figure that out this week and hopefully...
283801	286825	Get that out the door, be ready.
286805	290284	this FTP thing that you're doing, is that a manual process?
290264	294385	the ones that, yeah, for the MMS at this point.
294365	295714	the same going forward?
296016	299802	Well, eventually we'll get it set up the same as we do for
299782	305472	where they just click a button and it exports and throws it out to their FTP.
305452	307128	So it's now something we'll have to do here?
307734	308158	Okay.
308583	309572	Eventually, yes.
309805	310570	That would be nice.
311093	315259	I was going to say, if you want me to do something with that when you're not here.
315239	319662	I can do that, but it all depends on the sensitivity of it and all that.
319762	321250	So if it deals with paychecks
321230	323730	I don't know.
324284	327409	and it is the sets of data
327389	329364	It doesn't take long.
329586	332286	I mean, it's a couple minutes at most.
332266	334079	just text file and put it on FTP.
334482	336235	Jordan was saying,
336215	339238	The other day, the life insurance ended up being
339218	342799	Not good because like four people died this year that had it or something.
342779	344609	Like on the floor, it was crazy.
344991	345213	Wow.
345534	345756	Yeah.
346198	346440	Really?
346781	348672	Yeah, they like got too hot.
348652	349585	This year?
349606	351675	Yeah, since we had life insurance.
351655	352907	They died at work?
353007	354098	Yeah, apparently.
354118	354582	What?
354844	355793	You know about this.
356178	357164	I don't know about that.
357224	358230	That's what Jordan said.
358974	360061	Jordan's blowing smoke.
360222	361328	He might have been.
361713	364998	I feel like there would have been news if we had four people that have dropped.
365018	366711	I don't think it was the same day.
366691	370761	about that yeah I heard about it I don't know about you guys
371652	373883	You said the stroke out, I assume died.
374318	375806	Maybe they just overheated them.
376269	380110	Yeah, that's probably more likely they overheated.
380090	385088	heat stroke and had to go sit in the corner somewhere and rest under the air conditioner.
385068	388433	I'm gonna go call him, send you guys all a message.
389038	390690	Okay, yeah, put it in Slack.
392206	393494	But yeah, I was like, really?
393514	394239	And he's like, yeah.
394481	397963	He's like, because he was like, life insurance ended up being badly.
397943	400967	three or four, I think he said four.
400947	405439	Which I mean, some people may have like, I don't think they've died here.
405942	409017	It might have not been here, but...
410600	415429	I could see somebody out there mowing the grass stroking out because I...
415409	416960	Nearly done that myself.
418409	419698	I was like I won't do that again
419678	422702	I was like, well, you know they don't drink water.
422682	423468	Probably.
423548	426410	And he's like, yeah, I think most of them just drink energy drinks.
426430	426752	I was like,
426732	430043	Weird, I don't want to know.
433077	434411	Anything under said?
435604	436675	Three things.
436655	439074	are queued as of this morning.
439094	441231	They are the privacy policy for
441211	443088	shallow aspect of the cliffs.
443834	446074	And that's all we have planned.
446054	449088	Wasn't there one for the main site too?
449128	451660	There was a ticket that came in
451640	455119	Yeah, I guess that'll go out this week.
455420	457161	But that too.
457850	457971	Great.
460988	463736	That's just text on the bottom of the screen, right?
463877	463978	Yeah.
467485	468434	Alright.
470405	473809	Ticket-wise, it was pretty quiet last week.
473890	473990	Yeah.
474010	474474	Which was good.
474494	475521	Sounds like bad.
475501	476821	Really?
478555	480987	I think we have one or two calls from Jordan.
481510	483942	I got one from Jeff, but it was an easy one.
483922	486314	Jordan called it a couple times for you.
486696	489932	Yeah, they're trying to switch banks.
489912	493307	and they're seeing if the ACH format worked.
493287	498522	But this bank uses a different format, apparently.
498772	504782	They say it's ACH, but all the numbers are in different places, and we've been working through this.
504762	504924	you
506585	511785	So I don't know, because the bank said, I don't know, we always just tell people ACH and it works.
511765	515920	But it looks like what we figured out is
516541	520965	it goes like the current banks go account to account
520945	526821	and like they process it but this bank uses a third party processor so it goes to that
526801	530736	processor first and then to the bank and then to our account.
530716	535562	I'm sure there's like a different file format name that we can
535542	537241	but I don't know.
538132	539325	So this is the main?
539305	543493	Yeah, they're thinking about switching the main WW account.
543473	547375	But right now we're just testing with two
547912	551073	that are already at that thing.
551093	552724	One of the other companies.
552704	556403	I'm just trying to do a transfer.
556383	560537	But then Chris sent me a link to this
560517	566393	website called Modern Treasury that looks like it has potential to
566373	571860	not even use the bank and you hook your bank account to it and then they provide an API
571840	576028	or you can do transactions from account that you
576008	581142	And I was looking more into that on Friday, Jordan.
581122	585107	kept calling so I didn't get 100% into it but it does look
585087	589410	possible and then that would fix the issue we're having with
589390	593443	Fortune foundry where we couldn't transfer
593423	598928	correctly between accounts because we would upload an ACH file for each account.
598908	602708	It wasn't really as safe much.
602688	606741	but they only give you information if you request a demo?
606721	610757	So I wanna make sure that it actually fits all our needs before I'm like,
610737	613250	Hey, we should do a meeting together.
613753	615904	What did you say it was called?
615884	617541	Modern treasury.
619107	620193	Yeah, Chris found it.
620253	624375	I don't know how he found it, but it does look like a good candidate for
624355	628358	that as long as they're not like a scam or something.
628338	632442	I think I was using chat GPT research.
632422	636981	I had an old chat from where we were looking at stuff for Fortune Foundry before.
637518	642347	And I think I just updated my specifications for what.
642327	646853	we were looking for and it provided that as an option.
647153	652270	It seems like it could work because they
652739	654594	do like five different things.
654634	658243	I'm sure they try to sell you on everything and that's why they want to do a demo.
658223	663087	But for us, it looks like they provide an API
663067	665549	with several different endpoints.
665751	667204	And then you kind of hook your,
667184	669550	bank to it and I guess they
670323	674562	generated ACH file behind the scenes via there.
674542	678898	One thing I couldn't quite tell looking at it, it almost looked like they
678878	681143	It had a dashboard where you could
681460	686998	set up transfers and transactions like from their portal too.
686978	689192	I just kind of wonder if they
689729	694592	Like if they couldn't do what Fortune Foundry is doing,
694572	697782	It might be able to.
697762	700887	If you have that depth to it, you know the
700867	706287	Fortune foundry is not super complicated, but there is a pretty significant hierarchy that is running through.
706267	709965	but like a bit with you it looked like you could set up
709945	714522	It's pretty standard, straightforward automated transactions, but it would actually
714502	717154	do a force in Calvary God, that would be
717252	718284	Cool.
718304	720630	Yeah, I don't know what all their...
720610	726402	Dashboard does because I saw they had the dashboard and then they have like
726382	731683	some sort of payroll thing and like they had five or six different softwares and I was
731663	737033	I was looking into it and then Jordan called back and I was like, hey, how's this ACH transfer thing going?
737013	741302	Oh yeah, I kind of forgot about you.
741282	746230	But last I talked to Jordan was Friday and we were waiting on the bank.
746210	750162	So I'm sure they probably got back with him this morning.
750142	753368	I know Ethan has that on the list.
753348	756861	like getting fortune foundry out and finished at some point.
756841	761569	I think we'll have to like expedite that probably more than what he did.
761549	767475	was planning like the vibe of getting down there where they're getting really tired like especially in this
767455	768761	Looking at switching banks now.
770007	773162	They're doing the distributions more frequently.
773142	778545	and then like getting like 15 checks and 15 deposits dumped out with different banks
778525	784536	and then having to go physically drive these papers to the bank is getting old.
784702	786527	Yeah, I could see that for sure.
786895	792315	So I know what we had and I think that's where we landed before we were wanting like
792869	796686	Like being able to dump everything into a file and process it when we couldn't
796666	801732	but like now like we don't really care even if we just have to spit out 15 files and manually
801712	806558	manually upload 15 files of different things, that's better than what we're doing.
807213	812802	Which that wouldn't be too hard to generate a file for each.
812782	818758	Like if they switch and we have different format types.
818738	824243	If the modern treasury thing would...
824223	825815	Take care of that, that would be nice.
826138	827770	That would be nice.
828678	833676	It seems more likely than any of the other ones I've looked at.
838195	841422	Okay, so you're...
841402	844425	This side, project, finance, hand.
844405	848307	Yes, I called it a side quest.
848978	852610	So is that related to that issue that you put in?
852590	853676	Friday?
854018	854420	Yeah.
854762	858381	It started on Thursday and I made the ticket Friday because it
858361	860980	Carrying it into Friday and now it's carrying it into Monday.
861484	864203	That's super helpful though.
864183	870193	could put stuff in there like Jordan called and it just sends you a team's message and send you an email and
870173	872027	And it's all good.
872168	873619	And we don't have to have him under.
873599	876859	him on there as a stakeholder so he doesn't get bombed.
877042	878712	And it's great.
879557	881871	Originally, I was like, oh, this is just the one-op.
881851	885600	They just wanted to generate a file and they called it like...
885580	888297	45 and they're like, hey, can we get this by four?
888357	890933	And I was like, oh yes, I actually do a bold.
890913	894915	request for some reason and
894895	898543	So I didn't make a ticket, but then it carried in, so yeah.
898523	901176	I think I just made it an issue.
901358	902626	Yeah, that's fine.
902646	903008	I guess.
904175	905021	Depends on you.
905061	905866	It's not a bug.
905886	907335	It's not a...
907771	909987	It's not a new app.
910148	911216	So it's an issue, I guess.
913029	913613	Yeah.
922013	926505	I don't know if CK has talked to you at all, Chris, but he was
926485	929796	He demoed me his...
930873	933234	Smart Bear Replacement app.
933254	934586	Oh, yeah?
934606	934707	Yeah.
934687	936905	and it's pretty simple right now.
936926	939043	I gave them a couple,
939614	945287	suggestions, pointers on the UI side of things.
945267	946503	Yeah, it's...
947039	952746	He's getting to where he thinks we can get out of Smart Bear eventually.
952726	956138	Probably not this year, but yeah.
956118	957065	It's looking good.
957669	961234	So that would take one thing off of our books.
963340	968608	But yeah, once it gets to a good place to show you what it does and looks like, we'll show them too.
968588	973047	Anything else?
975237	976406	Def code next week.
977132	978462	Next week?
978683	978784	Okay.
978764	981840	That's Thursday, or sorry, Tuesday through?
981920	984775	Yeah, we'll leave Tuesday and fly back Monday.
984755	988721	Is Natalie going to that?
988741	989888	I think so.
992922	995276	which I thought.
995296	997549	So it was six, two.
999520	1001536	Shane and Jake.
1001556	1003371	Steven and Adeline.
1009291	1010743	Do you have any facts?
1010763	1012356	I have several small facts.
1012397	1014272	I could not think of it as a big one.
1014623	1019757	But one, this is more practical than interesting, but
1019737	1025747	You know, the detergent that you get, it comes with like a cup and it's got like
1025727	1027565	the loads on it or whatever.
1028293	1030050	Well, modern washers,
1030030	1034033	you only need like one tablespoon and
1034013	1040023	I don't know what they recommend that is probably like at least five tablespoons for like the
1040003	1044022	So they're ripping you off, basically.
1044042	1045288	Yeah, they're also...
1045268	1050469	like destroying the washers when you do it too, if you do too much.
1050770	1054924	The second one is male black widow spiders don't
1054904	1056541	look like black widow spiders.
1056562	1058704	They're small, they're like that big.
1058684	1063648	But the way you can, if you ever see a small spider like about that big,
1063628	1069352	that has white, black, yellow, and red stripes on the back.
1069332	1073301	Probably a male black widow spider.
1073281	1075741	Are they poisonous like the females?
1076306	1078363	As far as I know, yeah.
1078698	1082127	Ant Mill, this one.
1082343	1085940	It would be depressing if they weren't just ants and termites,
1085920	1088944	Basically, wherever they go, they leave
1088924	1092403	a trail and the trail evaporates.
1092383	1095407	So if the route is good,
1095387	1101212	and a lot of ants are using it, the trail doesn't evaporate and it's stronger because they keep going.
1101682	1106460	Well, if one amp loops back through the original trail
1106862	1112620	and enough ants start doing that, it will cause what's called an ant mill.
1112600	1116231	where they basically just go in a circle until they die.
1116211	1119488	and they pile up like piles of them.
1119468	1120895	and it doesn't stop.
1121217	1125478	And each time another ant comes along, it just strengthens the trail.
1125458	1125492	Thank you.
1126758	1132195	The last one is about poison dart frogs.
1132175	1134186	They have
1135617	1140987	I'm not sure if it might actually be poison, either poison or venom on their skin.
1140967	1145490	and that can be used to make Dart sense of name.
1145510	1146977	But what I didn't know
1146957	1151938	is that they obtain or they develop that poison
1152307	1155988	from the food that they consume.
1155968	1158688	you can get them in pet stores
1158972	1163785	and they're safe because they're not eating those like that.
1163984	1168307	I'm assuming it's like bullet amps, which are like really
1168287	1173167	powerful ants in jungle climates, but
1173856	1179867	I don't know how much they were, less than $50, but you can get them at like PetSmart or whatever.
1179847	1183697	So long as you don't have bullet and two should be fine.
1183930	1185137	So that's what they read?
1185539	1186022	What's the book?
1186123	1186907	Bullet ants?
1186927	1189603	Probably bullet ants.
1190107	1194615	I'm almost certain bullet ants, but probably a variety of things.
1194595	1198328	Yeah, I've seen videos at the bulletin.
1198308	1201905	When we were in Costa Rica,
1201885	1205363	For our crews, we saw one of those bullpen ants.
1205423	1206549	They're huge.
1206569	1207896	They're like that big.
1207876	1213330	I wonder if you can or they probably do make some kind of a
1213310	1218578	simulate or collect that scent that those ants make.
1219368	1225176	maybe you could you can put it somewhere and make them go somewhere that would be
1225797	1228355	way to control your hands in your house?
1228737	1230610	I actually had
1230843	1235048	a professor, Dr. Zhang I.
1235028	1236883	that tried that.
1236943	1239604	He said he had an amp problem at his desk.
1239584	1245392	I don't remember what he was doing, but he tried to use their own pheromones to rob them, but he said it didn't work.
1245372	1246928	America.
1253573	1254859	Chris, are you here tonight?
1255480	1261491	no good i i did schedule a couple of meetings this afternoon that i invited you to
1261471	1261664	you
1261842	1264054	Was that for today?
1264818	1265381	Yeah.
1265401	1265682	Okay.
1265702	1267532	I didn't know if it was for Friday or today.
1267512	1269924	Yeah, no, I sent them up there.
1270025	1273523	I invited to eat them too, because I thought they'd be back.
1273503	1279513	We can talk and see if we just want to be us or if we want to like lift Jacob in or somebody else.
1279493	1281586	Okay.
1281606	1282854	Yeah, that'll work.
1282875	1284525	You have to go through,
1284505	1288189	Go to the main office after this but I'll call you after that.
1288229	1289115	Okay, that'll work.
1290158	1293490	All right, that's all I got.
1293511	1293773	Thanks, guys.
