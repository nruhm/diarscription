WEBVTT

00:14.527 --> 00:15.273
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying...

00:15.877 --> 00:20.824
[SPEAKER_04]: We were the home team, so if they would score, we'd have to score and come back.

00:20.804 --> 00:26.798
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like in my mind, I'm like, I really don't want to keep playing.

00:26.778 --> 00:31.017
[SPEAKER_05]: And they kept tying it up.

00:30.997 --> 00:34.595
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd come back and tie it up and play another inning.

00:34.615 --> 00:36.906
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were going to have to go to the bullpen.

00:36.886 --> 00:38.095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

00:38.115 --> 00:39.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you guys please allude?

00:39.666 --> 00:41.600
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

00:41.620 --> 00:42.829
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw the fingers.

00:42.809 --> 00:48.567
[SPEAKER_05]: You're throwing to your own team, so.

00:49.812 --> 00:54.186
[SPEAKER_05]: so that I actually did strike out the last girl.

00:54.166 --> 01:00.177
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, okay.

01:00.157 --> 01:06.167
[SPEAKER_05]: Which the other team had scored like four runs at the top of the inning, so it was going to be hard for us to catch anyway.

01:06.147 --> 01:11.145
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it was a long, long day.

01:13.707 --> 01:14.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

01:16.796 --> 01:16.917
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

01:16.938 --> 01:17.220
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.768
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is it for today.

01:21.183 --> 01:27.193
[SPEAKER_05]: this evening back Wednesday Greg's out and CK is

01:27.173 --> 01:30.889
[SPEAKER_05]: at that, at the moment.

01:32.371 --> 01:33.758
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't go to a normal doctor?

01:34.884 --> 01:37.538
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's cheaper.

01:37.518 --> 01:40.416
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a cat named Kat.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.448
[SPEAKER_03]: A cat named Kat.

01:42.428 --> 01:45.752
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I go, it's so expensive.

01:45.772 --> 01:46.820
[SPEAKER_03]: The doctor or the vet?

01:46.901 --> 01:47.646
[SPEAKER_03]: The vet.

01:47.626 --> 01:49.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he has vet insurance.

01:50.642 --> 01:53.417
[SPEAKER_06]: I do need to make Mabel an appointment.

01:53.397 --> 01:55.890
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this week sometime.

01:55.910 --> 01:59.408
[SPEAKER_06]: I do need to make Mabel an appointment for this week sometime.

01:59.388 --> 02:03.222
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what do you do with her when you leave?

02:03.556 --> 02:09.415
[SPEAKER_06]: Like once a week we'll take her to daycare and that seems to pretty well wipe her out.

02:09.395 --> 02:11.124
[SPEAKER_06]: for the rest of the week.

02:11.144 --> 02:11.767
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.

02:12.129 --> 02:14.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, she just stays in her saloon.

02:14.139 --> 02:14.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.386
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it have a dog door on it?

02:18.873 --> 02:19.928
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:19.908 --> 02:22.637
[SPEAKER_06]: usually sleeps long enough that she doesn't go to the bathroom.

02:23.162 --> 02:23.910
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

02:23.890 --> 02:25.620
[SPEAKER_06]: and the dog likes to sleep.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.123
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.

02:26.646 --> 02:26.907
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:27.611 --> 02:28.838
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends, like,

02:28.818 --> 02:32.374
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a basset, too, and I feel like the thing's always peeing.

02:32.535 --> 02:34.423
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to leave all the time.

02:34.403 --> 02:36.074
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta go let the dog out.

02:36.276 --> 02:39.840
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times it's gonna work like in the morning

02:39.820 --> 02:44.080
[SPEAKER_06]: go home with lunch and take her out.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.426
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was

02:46.722 --> 02:50.413
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever day that was, I worked from home last week.

02:50.433 --> 02:50.877
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like,

02:51.633 --> 02:54.201
[SPEAKER_06]: 2.15 before she actually got out of bed.

02:55.075 --> 02:59.196
[SPEAKER_06]: She never got up in the morning to go to the bathroom.

02:59.176 --> 03:05.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we went to bed like 9 or 10 o'clock the night before she slept until 2.15

03:05.167 --> 03:09.591
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that he doesn't want to go out there either.

03:09.571 --> 03:15.430
[SPEAKER_06]: she kind of likes she'll like go sit out in the backyard and just like bask in the sun for like 15 minutes

03:15.410 --> 03:21.218
[SPEAKER_06]: and then come back in all hot and go back to sleep.

03:21.738 --> 03:24.031
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta park cat fast and hound.

03:24.172 --> 03:27.411
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives them a different meaning to the term, it's a dog's life.

03:27.391 --> 03:28.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

03:30.580 --> 03:33.958
[SPEAKER_06]: She was freaking out the other day with her mess up the piece, too.

03:35.103 --> 03:38.616
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, I want to leave him outside too.

03:39.575 --> 03:43.595
[SPEAKER_06]: He died bombing her instead of the air conditioner.

03:43.615 --> 03:45.585
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't let her out.

03:47.675 --> 03:52.538
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, this will be a quick one, I'm sure.

03:52.518 --> 03:53.821
[SPEAKER_05]: The...

03:54.948 --> 03:56.683
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any releases?

03:57.046 --> 03:59.406
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get a cabinet order I think we're in.

03:59.386 --> 04:05.211
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got...

04:06.642 --> 04:11.353
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're finally done with the formatting of the

04:11.333 --> 04:15.133
[SPEAKER_05]: the Lincoln file for Ethan's side.

04:15.113 --> 04:19.251
[SPEAKER_05]: The main thing we gotta get fixed now

04:19.231 --> 04:24.128
[SPEAKER_05]: NSYNC is the data because we don't know what they have loaded.

04:24.108 --> 04:28.600
[SPEAKER_05]: What we have is the truth, but we don't know what they have.

04:28.580 --> 04:32.059
[SPEAKER_05]: get it all back in sync and they don't seem to understand

04:32.039 --> 04:36.008
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we could just take our data and use it.

04:35.988 --> 04:39.788
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to make sure it's in sync with what they have.

04:40.763 --> 04:43.433
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll figure that out this week and hopefully...

04:43.801 --> 04:46.825
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that out the door, be ready.

04:46.805 --> 04:50.284
[SPEAKER_07]: this FTP thing that you're doing, is that a manual process?

04:50.264 --> 04:54.385
[SPEAKER_07]: the ones that, yeah, for the MMS at this point.

04:54.365 --> 04:55.714
[SPEAKER_07]: the same going forward?

04:56.016 --> 04:59.802
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, eventually we'll get it set up the same as we do for

04:59.782 --> 05:05.472
[SPEAKER_05]: where they just click a button and it exports and throws it out to their FTP.

05:05.452 --> 05:07.128
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's now something we'll have to do here?

05:07.734 --> 05:08.158
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

05:08.583 --> 05:09.572
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually, yes.

05:09.805 --> 05:10.570
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be nice.

05:11.093 --> 05:15.259
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, if you want me to do something with that when you're not here.

05:15.239 --> 05:19.662
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do that, but it all depends on the sensitivity of it and all that.

05:19.762 --> 05:21.250
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it deals with paychecks

05:21.230 --> 05:23.730
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

05:24.284 --> 05:27.409
[SPEAKER_05]: and it is the sets of data

05:27.389 --> 05:29.364
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't take long.

05:29.586 --> 05:32.286
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a couple minutes at most.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.079
[SPEAKER_05]: just text file and put it on FTP.

05:34.482 --> 05:36.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan was saying,

05:36.215 --> 05:39.238
[SPEAKER_03]: The other day, the life insurance ended up being

05:39.218 --> 05:42.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Not good because like four people died this year that had it or something.

05:42.779 --> 05:44.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Like on the floor, it was crazy.

05:44.991 --> 05:45.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

05:45.534 --> 05:45.756
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

05:46.198 --> 05:46.440
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

05:46.781 --> 05:48.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they like got too hot.

05:48.652 --> 05:49.585
[SPEAKER_05]: This year?

05:49.606 --> 05:51.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, since we had life insurance.

05:51.655 --> 05:52.907
[SPEAKER_03]: They died at work?

05:53.007 --> 05:54.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, apparently.

05:54.118 --> 05:54.582
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

05:54.844 --> 05:55.793
[SPEAKER_03]: You know about this.

05:56.178 --> 05:57.164
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.230
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Jordan said.

05:58.974 --> 06:00.061
[SPEAKER_05]: Jordan's blowing smoke.

06:00.222 --> 06:01.328
[SPEAKER_05]: He might have been.

06:01.713 --> 06:04.998
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there would have been news if we had four people that have dropped.

06:05.018 --> 06:06.711
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it was the same day.

06:06.691 --> 06:10.761
[SPEAKER_03]: about that yeah I heard about it I don't know about you guys

06:11.652 --> 06:13.883
[SPEAKER_03]: You said the stroke out, I assume died.

06:14.318 --> 06:15.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they just overheated them.

06:16.269 --> 06:20.110
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's probably more likely they overheated.

06:20.090 --> 06:25.088
[SPEAKER_07]: heat stroke and had to go sit in the corner somewhere and rest under the air conditioner.

06:25.068 --> 06:28.433
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go call him, send you guys all a message.

06:29.038 --> 06:30.690
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, put it in Slack.

06:32.206 --> 06:33.494
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I was like, really?

06:33.514 --> 06:34.239
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, yeah.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.963
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, because he was like, life insurance ended up being badly.

06:37.943 --> 06:40.967
[SPEAKER_03]: three or four, I think he said four.

06:40.947 --> 06:45.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I mean, some people may have like, I don't think they've died here.

06:45.942 --> 06:49.017
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have not been here, but...

06:50.600 --> 06:55.429
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see somebody out there mowing the grass stroking out because I...

06:55.409 --> 06:56.960
[SPEAKER_07]: Nearly done that myself.

06:58.409 --> 06:59.698
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like I won't do that again

06:59.678 --> 07:02.702
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, well, you know they don't drink water.

07:02.682 --> 07:03.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.410
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, yeah, I think most of them just drink energy drinks.

07:06.430 --> 07:06.752
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like,

07:06.732 --> 07:10.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird, I don't want to know.

07:13.077 --> 07:14.411
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything under said?

07:15.604 --> 07:16.675
[SPEAKER_01]: Three things.

07:16.655 --> 07:19.074
[SPEAKER_01]: are queued as of this morning.

07:19.094 --> 07:21.231
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the privacy policy for

07:21.211 --> 07:23.088
[SPEAKER_01]: shallow aspect of the cliffs.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.074
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all we have planned.

07:26.054 --> 07:29.088
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't there one for the main site too?

07:29.128 --> 07:31.660
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a ticket that came in

07:31.640 --> 07:35.119
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess that'll go out this week.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.161
[SPEAKER_01]: But that too.

07:37.850 --> 07:37.971
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

07:40.988 --> 07:43.736
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just text on the bottom of the screen, right?

07:43.877 --> 07:43.978
Yeah.

07:47.485 --> 07:48.434
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

07:50.405 --> 07:53.809
[SPEAKER_05]: Ticket-wise, it was pretty quiet last week.

07:53.890 --> 07:53.990
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

07:54.010 --> 07:54.474
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was good.

07:54.494 --> 07:55.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like bad.

07:55.501 --> 07:56.821
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

07:58.555 --> 08:00.987
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have one or two calls from Jordan.

08:01.510 --> 08:03.942
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one from Jeff, but it was an easy one.

08:03.922 --> 08:06.314
[SPEAKER_07]: Jordan called it a couple times for you.

08:06.696 --> 08:09.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're trying to switch banks.

08:09.912 --> 08:13.307
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're seeing if the ACH format worked.

08:13.287 --> 08:18.522
[SPEAKER_03]: But this bank uses a different format, apparently.

08:18.772 --> 08:24.782
[SPEAKER_03]: They say it's ACH, but all the numbers are in different places, and we've been working through this.

08:24.762 --> 08:24.924
you

08:26.585 --> 08:31.785
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, because the bank said, I don't know, we always just tell people ACH and it works.

08:31.765 --> 08:35.920
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks like what we figured out is

08:36.541 --> 08:40.965
[SPEAKER_03]: it goes like the current banks go account to account

08:40.945 --> 08:46.821
[SPEAKER_03]: and like they process it but this bank uses a third party processor so it goes to that

08:46.801 --> 08:50.736
[SPEAKER_03]: processor first and then to the bank and then to our account.

08:50.716 --> 08:55.562
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's like a different file format name that we can

08:55.542 --> 08:57.241
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't know.

08:58.132 --> 08:59.325
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the main?

08:59.305 --> 09:03.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're thinking about switching the main WW account.

09:03.473 --> 09:07.375
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now we're just testing with two

09:07.912 --> 09:11.073
[SPEAKER_03]: that are already at that thing.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.724
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the other companies.

09:12.704 --> 09:16.403
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to do a transfer.

09:16.383 --> 09:20.537
[SPEAKER_03]: But then Chris sent me a link to this

09:20.517 --> 09:26.393
[SPEAKER_03]: website called Modern Treasury that looks like it has potential to

09:26.373 --> 09:31.860
[SPEAKER_03]: not even use the bank and you hook your bank account to it and then they provide an API

09:31.840 --> 09:36.028
[SPEAKER_03]: or you can do transactions from account that you

09:36.008 --> 09:41.142
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was looking more into that on Friday, Jordan.

09:41.122 --> 09:45.107
[SPEAKER_03]: kept calling so I didn't get 100% into it but it does look

09:45.087 --> 09:49.410
[SPEAKER_03]: possible and then that would fix the issue we're having with

09:49.390 --> 09:53.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortune foundry where we couldn't transfer

09:53.423 --> 09:58.928
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly between accounts because we would upload an ACH file for each account.

09:58.908 --> 10:02.708
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really as safe much.

10:02.688 --> 10:06.741
[SPEAKER_03]: but they only give you information if you request a demo?

10:06.721 --> 10:10.757
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanna make sure that it actually fits all our needs before I'm like,

10:10.737 --> 10:13.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we should do a meeting together.

10:13.753 --> 10:15.904
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you say it was called?

10:15.884 --> 10:17.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern treasury.

10:19.107 --> 10:20.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Chris found it.

10:20.253 --> 10:24.375
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how he found it, but it does look like a good candidate for

10:24.355 --> 10:28.358
[SPEAKER_03]: that as long as they're not like a scam or something.

10:28.338 --> 10:32.442
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was using chat GPT research.

10:32.422 --> 10:36.981
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an old chat from where we were looking at stuff for Fortune Foundry before.

10:37.518 --> 10:42.347
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I just updated my specifications for what.

10:42.327 --> 10:46.853
[SPEAKER_02]: we were looking for and it provided that as an option.

10:47.153 --> 10:52.270
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like it could work because they

10:52.739 --> 10:54.594
[SPEAKER_03]: do like five different things.

10:54.634 --> 10:58.243
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they try to sell you on everything and that's why they want to do a demo.

10:58.223 --> 11:03.087
[SPEAKER_03]: But for us, it looks like they provide an API

11:03.067 --> 11:05.549
[SPEAKER_03]: with several different endpoints.

11:05.751 --> 11:07.204
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you kind of hook your,

11:07.184 --> 11:09.550
[SPEAKER_03]: bank to it and I guess they

11:10.323 --> 11:14.562
[SPEAKER_03]: generated ACH file behind the scenes via there.

11:14.542 --> 11:18.898
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I couldn't quite tell looking at it, it almost looked like they

11:18.878 --> 11:21.143
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a dashboard where you could

11:21.460 --> 11:26.998
[SPEAKER_02]: set up transfers and transactions like from their portal too.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.192
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of wonder if they

11:29.729 --> 11:34.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they couldn't do what Fortune Foundry is doing,

11:34.572 --> 11:37.782
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be able to.

11:37.762 --> 11:40.887
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have that depth to it, you know the

11:40.867 --> 11:46.287
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortune foundry is not super complicated, but there is a pretty significant hierarchy that is running through.

11:46.267 --> 11:49.965
[SPEAKER_02]: but like a bit with you it looked like you could set up

11:49.945 --> 11:54.522
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty standard, straightforward automated transactions, but it would actually

11:54.502 --> 11:57.154
[SPEAKER_02]: do a force in Calvary God, that would be

11:57.252 --> 11:58.284
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

11:58.304 --> 12:00.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know what all their...

12:00.610 --> 12:06.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Dashboard does because I saw they had the dashboard and then they have like

12:06.382 --> 12:11.683
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of payroll thing and like they had five or six different softwares and I was

12:11.663 --> 12:17.033
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking into it and then Jordan called back and I was like, hey, how's this ACH transfer thing going?

12:17.013 --> 12:21.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I kind of forgot about you.

12:21.282 --> 12:26.230
[SPEAKER_03]: But last I talked to Jordan was Friday and we were waiting on the bank.

12:26.210 --> 12:30.162
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure they probably got back with him this morning.

12:30.142 --> 12:33.368
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Ethan has that on the list.

12:33.348 --> 12:36.861
[SPEAKER_02]: like getting fortune foundry out and finished at some point.

12:36.841 --> 12:41.569
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll have to like expedite that probably more than what he did.

12:41.549 --> 12:47.475
[SPEAKER_02]: was planning like the vibe of getting down there where they're getting really tired like especially in this

12:47.455 --> 12:48.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at switching banks now.

12:50.007 --> 12:53.162
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing the distributions more frequently.

12:53.142 --> 12:58.545
[SPEAKER_02]: and then like getting like 15 checks and 15 deposits dumped out with different banks

12:58.525 --> 13:04.536
[SPEAKER_02]: and then having to go physically drive these papers to the bank is getting old.

13:04.702 --> 13:06.527
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could see that for sure.

13:06.895 --> 13:12.315
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know what we had and I think that's where we landed before we were wanting like

13:12.869 --> 13:16.686
[SPEAKER_02]: Like being able to dump everything into a file and process it when we couldn't

13:16.666 --> 13:21.732
[SPEAKER_02]: but like now like we don't really care even if we just have to spit out 15 files and manually

13:21.712 --> 13:26.558
[SPEAKER_02]: manually upload 15 files of different things, that's better than what we're doing.

13:27.213 --> 13:32.802
[SPEAKER_03]: Which that wouldn't be too hard to generate a file for each.

13:32.782 --> 13:38.758
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if they switch and we have different format types.

13:38.738 --> 13:44.243
[SPEAKER_02]: If the modern treasury thing would...

13:44.223 --> 13:45.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of that, that would be nice.

13:46.138 --> 13:47.770
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be nice.

13:48.678 --> 13:53.676
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems more likely than any of the other ones I've looked at.

13:58.195 --> 14:01.422
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you're...

14:01.402 --> 14:04.425
[SPEAKER_05]: This side, project, finance, hand.

14:04.405 --> 14:08.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I called it a side quest.

14:08.978 --> 14:12.610
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that related to that issue that you put in?

14:12.590 --> 14:13.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday?

14:14.018 --> 14:14.420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

14:14.762 --> 14:18.381
[SPEAKER_03]: It started on Thursday and I made the ticket Friday because it

14:18.361 --> 14:20.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Carrying it into Friday and now it's carrying it into Monday.

14:21.484 --> 14:24.203
[SPEAKER_07]: That's super helpful though.

14:24.183 --> 14:30.193
[SPEAKER_07]: could put stuff in there like Jordan called and it just sends you a team's message and send you an email and

14:30.173 --> 14:32.027
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all good.

14:32.168 --> 14:33.619
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't have to have him under.

14:33.599 --> 14:36.859
[SPEAKER_07]: him on there as a stakeholder so he doesn't get bombed.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.712
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great.

14:39.557 --> 14:41.871
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally, I was like, oh, this is just the one-op.

14:41.851 --> 14:45.600
[SPEAKER_03]: They just wanted to generate a file and they called it like...

14:45.580 --> 14:48.297
[SPEAKER_03]: 45 and they're like, hey, can we get this by four?

14:48.357 --> 14:50.933
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh yes, I actually do a bold.

14:50.913 --> 14:54.915
[SPEAKER_03]: request for some reason and

14:54.895 --> 14:58.543
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't make a ticket, but then it carried in, so yeah.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.176
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I just made it an issue.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's fine.

15:02.646 --> 15:03.008
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

15:04.175 --> 15:05.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on you.

15:05.061 --> 15:05.866
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a bug.

15:05.886 --> 15:07.335
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a...

15:07.771 --> 15:09.987
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a new app.

15:10.148 --> 15:11.216
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's an issue, I guess.

15:13.029 --> 15:13.613
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

15:22.013 --> 15:26.505
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if CK has talked to you at all, Chris, but he was

15:26.485 --> 15:29.796
[SPEAKER_05]: He demoed me his...

15:30.873 --> 15:33.234
[SPEAKER_05]: Smart Bear Replacement app.

15:33.254 --> 15:34.586
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah?

15:34.606 --> 15:34.707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

15:34.687 --> 15:36.905
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's pretty simple right now.

15:36.926 --> 15:39.043
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave them a couple,

15:39.614 --> 15:45.287
[SPEAKER_05]: suggestions, pointers on the UI side of things.

15:45.267 --> 15:46.503
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's...

15:47.039 --> 15:52.746
[SPEAKER_05]: He's getting to where he thinks we can get out of Smart Bear eventually.

15:52.726 --> 15:56.138
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not this year, but yeah.

15:56.118 --> 15:57.065
[SPEAKER_05]: It's looking good.

15:57.669 --> 16:01.234
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would take one thing off of our books.

16:03.340 --> 16:08.608
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, once it gets to a good place to show you what it does and looks like, we'll show them too.

16:08.588 --> 16:13.047
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

16:15.237 --> 16:16.406
[SPEAKER_06]: Def code next week.

16:17.132 --> 16:18.462
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week?

16:18.683 --> 16:18.784
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

16:18.764 --> 16:21.840
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Thursday, or sorry, Tuesday through?

16:21.920 --> 16:24.775
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll leave Tuesday and fly back Monday.

16:24.755 --> 16:28.721
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Natalie going to that?

16:28.741 --> 16:29.888
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

16:32.922 --> 16:35.276
[SPEAKER_05]: which I thought.

16:35.296 --> 16:37.549
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was six, two.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.536
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane and Jake.

16:41.556 --> 16:43.371
[SPEAKER_05]: Steven and Adeline.

16:49.291 --> 16:50.743
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any facts?

16:50.763 --> 16:52.356
[SPEAKER_01]: I have several small facts.

16:52.397 --> 16:54.272
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not think of it as a big one.

16:54.623 --> 16:59.757
[SPEAKER_01]: But one, this is more practical than interesting, but

16:59.737 --> 17:05.747
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the detergent that you get, it comes with like a cup and it's got like

17:05.727 --> 17:07.565
[SPEAKER_01]: the loads on it or whatever.

17:08.293 --> 17:10.050
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, modern washers,

17:10.030 --> 17:14.033
[SPEAKER_01]: you only need like one tablespoon and

17:14.013 --> 17:20.023
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they recommend that is probably like at least five tablespoons for like the

17:20.003 --> 17:24.022
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're ripping you off, basically.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.288
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're also...

17:25.268 --> 17:30.469
[SPEAKER_01]: like destroying the washers when you do it too, if you do too much.

17:30.770 --> 17:34.924
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one is male black widow spiders don't

17:34.904 --> 17:36.541
[SPEAKER_01]: look like black widow spiders.

17:36.562 --> 17:38.704
[SPEAKER_01]: They're small, they're like that big.

17:38.684 --> 17:43.648
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way you can, if you ever see a small spider like about that big,

17:43.628 --> 17:49.352
[SPEAKER_01]: that has white, black, yellow, and red stripes on the back.

17:49.332 --> 17:53.301
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a male black widow spider.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.741
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they poisonous like the females?

17:56.306 --> 17:58.363
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, yeah.

17:58.698 --> 18:02.127
[SPEAKER_01]: Ant Mill, this one.

18:02.343 --> 18:05.940
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be depressing if they weren't just ants and termites,

18:05.920 --> 18:08.944
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, wherever they go, they leave

18:08.924 --> 18:12.403
[SPEAKER_01]: a trail and the trail evaporates.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.407
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the route is good,

18:15.387 --> 18:21.212
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of ants are using it, the trail doesn't evaporate and it's stronger because they keep going.

18:21.682 --> 18:26.460
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if one amp loops back through the original trail

18:26.862 --> 18:32.620
[SPEAKER_01]: and enough ants start doing that, it will cause what's called an ant mill.

18:32.600 --> 18:36.231
[SPEAKER_01]: where they basically just go in a circle until they die.

18:36.211 --> 18:39.488
[SPEAKER_01]: and they pile up like piles of them.

18:39.468 --> 18:40.895
[SPEAKER_01]: and it doesn't stop.

18:41.217 --> 18:45.478
[SPEAKER_01]: And each time another ant comes along, it just strengthens the trail.

18:46.758 --> 18:52.195
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one is about poison dart frogs.

18:52.175 --> 18:54.186
[SPEAKER_01]: They have

18:55.617 --> 19:00.987
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if it might actually be poison, either poison or venom on their skin.

19:00.967 --> 19:05.490
[SPEAKER_01]: and that can be used to make Dart sense of name.

19:05.510 --> 19:06.977
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I didn't know

19:06.957 --> 19:11.938
[SPEAKER_01]: is that they obtain or they develop that poison

19:12.307 --> 19:15.988
[SPEAKER_01]: from the food that they consume.

19:15.968 --> 19:18.688
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get them in pet stores

19:18.972 --> 19:23.785
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're safe because they're not eating those like that.

19:23.984 --> 19:28.307
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming it's like bullet amps, which are like really

19:28.287 --> 19:33.167
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful ants in jungle climates, but

19:33.856 --> 19:39.867
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much they were, less than $50, but you can get them at like PetSmart or whatever.

19:39.847 --> 19:43.697
[SPEAKER_01]: So long as you don't have bullet and two should be fine.

19:43.930 --> 19:45.137
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what they read?

19:45.539 --> 19:46.022
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the book?

19:46.123 --> 19:46.907
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullet ants?

19:46.927 --> 19:49.603
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably bullet ants.

19:50.107 --> 19:54.615
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost certain bullet ants, but probably a variety of things.

19:54.595 --> 19:58.328
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've seen videos at the bulletin.

19:58.308 --> 20:01.905
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were in Costa Rica,

20:01.885 --> 20:05.363
[SPEAKER_01]: For our crews, we saw one of those bullpen ants.

20:05.423 --> 20:06.549
[SPEAKER_01]: They're huge.

20:06.569 --> 20:07.896
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like that big.

20:07.876 --> 20:13.330
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if you can or they probably do make some kind of a

20:13.310 --> 20:18.578
[SPEAKER_07]: simulate or collect that scent that those ants make.

20:19.368 --> 20:25.176
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe you could you can put it somewhere and make them go somewhere that would be

20:25.797 --> 20:28.355
[SPEAKER_07]: way to control your hands in your house?

20:28.737 --> 20:30.610
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had

20:30.843 --> 20:35.048
[SPEAKER_01]: a professor, Dr. Zhang I.

20:35.028 --> 20:36.883
[SPEAKER_01]: that tried that.

20:36.943 --> 20:39.604
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he had an amp problem at his desk.

20:39.584 --> 20:45.392
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what he was doing, but he tried to use their own pheromones to rob them, but he said it didn't work.

20:45.372 --> 20:46.928
[SPEAKER_01]: America.

20:53.573 --> 20:54.859
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, are you here tonight?

20:55.480 --> 21:01.491
[SPEAKER_00]: no good i i did schedule a couple of meetings this afternoon that i invited you to

21:01.471 --> 21:01.664
[SPEAKER_00]: you

21:01.842 --> 21:04.054
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that for today?

21:04.818 --> 21:05.381
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

21:05.401 --> 21:05.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

21:05.702 --> 21:07.532
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know if it was for Friday or today.

21:07.512 --> 21:09.924
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I sent them up there.

21:10.025 --> 21:13.523
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited to eat them too, because I thought they'd be back.

21:13.503 --> 21:19.513
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk and see if we just want to be us or if we want to like lift Jacob in or somebody else.

21:19.493 --> 21:21.586
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

21:21.606 --> 21:22.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'll work.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.525
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go through,

21:24.505 --> 21:28.189
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the main office after this but I'll call you after that.

21:28.229 --> 21:29.115
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that'll work.

21:30.158 --> 21:33.490
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's all I got.

21:33.511 --> 21:33.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, guys.
