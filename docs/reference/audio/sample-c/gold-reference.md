# This did not happen 
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:15,273
[SPEAKER_00]: He's saying...

2
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:20,824
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the home team, so if they would score, we'd have to score and come back.

3
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:26,798
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like in my mind, I'm like, I really don't want to keep playing.

4
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:31,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kept tying it up.

5
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,595
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd come back and tie it up and play another inning.

6
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:36,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were going to have to go to the bullpen.

7
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

8
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:39,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you guys please lose?

9
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Start throwing ???

11
# A lot of laughter in the room that did not get picked up
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,567
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean. 
[SPEAKER_00]: You're throwing to your own team, so.

12
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:54,186
[SPEAKER_00]: so that I actually did strike out the last girl.

13
00:00:54,166 --> 00:01:00,177
# A lot of laughter, half of this had to be manual
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you throw with a little more pizzazz? 
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't try to but when it happened I was like, okay.

14
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:06,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Which the other team had scored like four runs at the top of the inning, so it was going to be hard for us to catch anyway.

15
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:11,145
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was a long, long day.

16
# 16-18 are people on Zoom talking so it is a bit unrecognizable
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:14,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

17
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:16,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

18
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:17,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
#

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,768
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is it for today.

20
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:27,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan will be back Wednesday Greg's out and CK is

21
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:30,889
[SPEAKER_00]: at the vet, at the moment. So...

22
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,758
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't go to a normal doctor?

23
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:37,538
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know he had any pets.

24
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:40,416
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a cat named Cat.

25
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh. A cat named Cat.

26
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:45,752
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd think it be cheaper. Every time I go, it's so expensive.

27
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,820
[SPEAKER_02]: The doctor or the vet?

28
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:47,646
[SPEAKER_00]: The vet.

29
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:49,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he has vet insurance.

30
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:53,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to make Mabel an appointment.

31
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this week sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what? 

32
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to make Mabel an appointment for this week sometime.

33
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:03,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what do you do with her when you leave? Do you put her in a kennel or anything?

34
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:09,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once a week we'll take her to daycare and that seems to pretty well wipe her out.

35
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,124
[SPEAKER_01]: for the rest of the week.

36
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:11,767
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.

37
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, she just stays in her sun room.

38
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:14,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.

39
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have a dog door on it?

40
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:19,928
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

41
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:22,637
[SPEAKER_01]: usually sleeps long enough that she doesn't go to the bathroom.

42
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:23,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

43
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,620
[SPEAKER_01]: and the dog likes to sleep.

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,123
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.

45
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:26,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

46
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,838
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends, like,

47
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a basset, too, and I feel like the thing's always peeing.

48
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:34,423
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to leave all the time.

49
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:36,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta go let the dog out.

50
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:39,840
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I gotta work like in the morning

51
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,080
[SPEAKER_01]: go home with lunch and take her out.

52
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was

53
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:50,413
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever day that was, I worked from home last week.

54
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:50,877
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like,

55
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:54,201
[SPEAKER_01]: 2:15 before she actually got out of bed.

56
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:59,196
[SPEAKER_01]: She never got up in the morning to go to the bathroom.

57
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:05,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we went to bed like 9 or 10 o'clock the night before she slept until 2:15

58
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:09,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure the heat doesn't 
[SPEAKER_01]: She hates the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't want to go out there either.

59
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:15,430
[SPEAKER_01]: she kind of likes she'll like go sit out in the backyard and just like bask in the sun for like 15 minutes

60
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:21,218
[SPEAKER_01]: and then come back in all hot and go back to sleep.

61
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:24,031
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta part cat basset hound.

62
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:27,411
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives them a different meaning to the term, it's a dog's life.

63
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,958
[SPEAKER_01]: She was freaking out the other day when we were messing with the bees, too.

65
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:38,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, I want to come outside too.

66
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:43,595
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd be dive bombing her instead of the air conditioner.

67
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:45,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't let her out.

68
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:52,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this will be a quick one, I'm sure.

69
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:53,821
[SPEAKER_00]: The...

70
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any releases?

71
# All of this was manual 
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:59,406
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get a cabinet order I think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna push it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and send it to testing
[SPEAKER_00]: Ok. 

72
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:05,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got...

73
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:11,353
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're finally done with the formatting of the

74
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:15,133
[SPEAKER_00]: the Lincoln file for Ethan's side.

75
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:19,251
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing we gotta get fixed now

76
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:24,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in sync is the data because we don't know what they have loaded.

77
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:28,600
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have is the truth, but we don't know what they have.

78
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,059
[SPEAKER_00]: To get it all back in sync and they don't seem to understand

79
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we could just take our data and use it.

80
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:39,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to make sure it's in sync with what they have.

81
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:43,433
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure that out this week and hopefully...

82
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that out the door, be ready.

83
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:50,284
[SPEAKER_03]: this FTP thing that you're doing, is that a manual process?

84
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:54,385
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that, yeah, for the MMS at this point.

85
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's gonna be the same going forward?

86
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:59,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, eventually we'll get it set up the same as we do for medical

87
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:05,472
[SPEAKER_00]: where they just click a button and it exports and throws it out to their FTP.

88
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,128
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's now something we'll have to do here?

89
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:08,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

90
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, yes.

91
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:10,570
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be nice.

92
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:15,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, if you want me to do something with that when you're not here.

93
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:19,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that, but it all depends on the sensitivity of it and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

94
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:21,250
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it deals with paychecks

95
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

96
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:27,409
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is the sets of data

97
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,364
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take long.

98
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:32,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a couple minutes at most.

99
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,079
[SPEAKER_00]: just take the file and put it on FTP.

100
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:36,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Jordan was saying,

101
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:39,238
[SPEAKER_02]: The other day, the life insurance ended up being

102
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:42,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Not good because like four people died this year that had it or something.

103
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on the floor, it was crazy.

104
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:45,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

105
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:45,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

106
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:46,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

107
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they like got too hot.

108
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:49,585
[SPEAKER_04]: This year?

109
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:51,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, since we had life insurance.

110
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:52,907
[SPEAKER_01]: They died at work?

111
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, apparently.

112
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:54,582
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

113
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:55,793
[SPEAKER_00]: You know about this.

114
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:57,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that.

115
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,230
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Jordan said.

116
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:00,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan's blowing smoke.

117
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:01,328
[SPEAKER_02]: He might have been.

118
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:04,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there would have been news if we had four people that have dropped dead on the floor.

119
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:06,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We would probably have heard about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like...

120
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:10,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about it, I don't know about you guys

121
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,883
[SPEAKER_02]: He said they strokef out, I assume died.

122
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:15,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they just overheated then.

123
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:20,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's probably more likely they overheated.

124
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,088
[SPEAKER_03]: heat stroke and had to go sit in the corner somewhere and rest under the air conditioner.

125
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:28,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go call him, send you guys all a message.

126
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:30,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, put it in Slack.

127
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:33,494
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I was like, really?

128
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:34,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah.

129
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:37,963
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, because he was like, life insurance ended up being badly.

130
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:40,967
[SPEAKER_02]: three or four, I think he said four.

131
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:45,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I mean, some people may have like, I don't think they've died here.

132
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:49,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have not been here, but...

133
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see somebody out there mowing the grass stroking out because I...

134
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Nearly done that myself. 

135
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like I won't do that again

136
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:02,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, you know they don't drink water.

137
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:03,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, probably.

138
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, I think most of them just drink energy drinks.

139
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like,

140
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:10,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird, I don't want to know.

141
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:14,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything on your side?

142
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:16,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Three things.

143
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:19,074
[SPEAKER_06]: are queued as of this morning.

144
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:21,231
[SPEAKER_06]: They are the privacy policy for

145
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:23,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Shiloh aspect of Eclipse.

146
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:26,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all we have planned.

147
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:29,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't there one for the main site too?

148
00:07:29,128 --> 00:07:31,660
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a ticket that came in I'll have someone work... 

149
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess that'll go out this week.

150
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,161
[SPEAKER_06]: But not today.

151
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:37,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

152
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:43,736
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just text on the bottom of the screen, right?

153
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:43,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

154
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:48,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

155
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:53,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Ticket-wise, it was pretty quiet last week.

156
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:53,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

157
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was good.

158
00:07:54,494 --> 00:07:55,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like bad.

159
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

160
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have one or two calls from Jordan.

161
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,942
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one from Jeff, but it was an easy one.

162
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:06,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan called in a couple times for you.

163
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're trying to switch banks.

164
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:13,307
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're seeing if the ACH format worked.

165
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:18,522
[SPEAKER_02]: But this bank uses a different format, apparently.

166
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:24,782
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's ACH, but all the numbers are in different places, and we've been working through this.

167
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:24,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

168
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:31,785
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, because the bank said, I don't know, we always just tell people ACH and it works.

169
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:35,920
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks like what we figured out is

170
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,965
[SPEAKER_02]: it goes like the current banks go account to account

171
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:46,821
[SPEAKER_02]: and like they process it but this bank uses a third party processor so it goes to that

172
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:50,736
[SPEAKER_02]: processor first and then to the bank and then to our account.

173
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:55,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's like a different file format name that we can call

174
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,241
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't know.

175
00:08:58,132 --> 00:08:59,325
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the main account?

176
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:03,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're thinking about switching the main WW account.

177
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:07,375
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now we're just testing with two companies

178
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:11,073
[SPEAKER_02]: that are already at that thing.

179
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,724
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other companies.

180
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:16,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to do a transfer.

181
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:20,537
[SPEAKER_02]: But then Chris sent me a link to this

182
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:26,393
[SPEAKER_02]: website called Modern Treasury that looks like it has potential to

183
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:31,860
[SPEAKER_02]: not even use the bank and you hook your bank account to it and then they provide an API

184
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,028
[SPEAKER_02]: or you can do transactions from accounts that you own

185
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:41,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was looking more into that on Friday, Jordan.

186
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:45,107
[SPEAKER_02]: kept calling so I didn't get 100% into it but it does look

187
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:49,410
[SPEAKER_02]: possible and then that would fix the issue we're having with

188
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortune foundry where we couldn't transfer

189
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:58,928
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly between accounts because we would upload an ACH file for each account.

190
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:02,708
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't really save that much.

191
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:06,741
[SPEAKER_02]: but they only give you information if you request a demo?

192
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:10,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanna make sure that it actually fits all our needs before I'm like,

193
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:13,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we should do a meeting together.

194
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,904
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you say it was called?

195
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:17,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Modern treasury.

196
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:20,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Chris found it.

197
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:24,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how he found it, but it does look like a good candidate for

198
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:28,358
[SPEAKER_03]: that as long as they're not like a scam or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

199
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:32,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I was using chat GPT research.

200
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:36,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I had an old chat from where we were looking at stuff for Fortune Foundry before.

201
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:42,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I just updated my specifications for what.

202
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:46,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Solution we were looking for and it provided that as an option.

203
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:52,270
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it could work because they

204
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,594
[SPEAKER_02]: do like five different things.

205
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:58,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they try to sell you on everything and that's why they want to do a demo.

206
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:03,087
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us, it looks like they provide an API

207
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,549
[SPEAKER_02]: with several different endpoints.

208
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:07,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you kind of hook your,

209
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:09,550
[SPEAKER_02]: bank to it and I guess they

210
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:14,562
[SPEAKER_02]: generated ACH file behind the scenes via there.

211
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:18,898
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I couldn't quite tell looking at it, it almost looked like they

212
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a dashboard where you could

213
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,998
[SPEAKER_05]: set up transfers and transactions like from their portal too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah

214
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of wonder if they

215
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:34,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if they couldn't do what Fortune Foundry is doing,

216
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:37,782
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be able to.

217
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:40,887
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have that depth to it, you know the

218
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:46,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Fortune foundry is not super complicated, but there is a pretty significant hierarchy that is running through.

219
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:49,965
[SPEAKER_05]: but like a bit with you it looked like you could set up

220
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:54,522
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty standard, straightforward automated transactions, but it would actually

221
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:57,154
[SPEAKER_05]: do a Fortune Foundary, that would be

222
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:58,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

223
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know what all their...

224
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:06,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Dashboard does because I saw they had the dashboard and then they have like

225
00:12:06,382 --> 00:12:11,683
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of payroll thing and like they had five or six different softwares and I was

226
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:17,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking into it and then Jordan called back and I was like, hey, how's this ACH transfer thing going?

227
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:21,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I kind of forgot about you.

228
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:26,230
[SPEAKER_02]: But last I talked to Jordan was Friday and we were waiting on the bank.

229
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure they probably got back with him this morning.

230
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:33,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Ethan has that on the list.

231
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:36,861
[SPEAKER_05]: like getting fortune foundry out and finished at some point.

232
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:41,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'll have to like expedite that probably more than what he did.

233
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:47,475
[SPEAKER_05]: was planning like the vibe of getting down there where they're getting really tired like especially in this

234
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:48,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at switching banks now.

235
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:53,162
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing the distributions more frequently.

236
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:58,545
[SPEAKER_05]: and then like getting like 15 checks and 15 deposits dumped out with different banks

237
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:04,536
[SPEAKER_05]: and then having to go physically drive these papers to the bank is getting old.

238
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I could see that for sure.

239
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:12,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know what we had and I think that's where we landed before we were wanting like

240
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:16,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Like being able to dump everything into a file and process it when we couldn't

241
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:21,732
[SPEAKER_05]: but like now like we don't really care even if we just have to spit out 15 files and manually

242
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:26,558
[SPEAKER_05]: manually upload 15 files of different things, that's better than what we're doing.

243
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:32,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. Which that wouldn't be too hard to generate a file for each.

244
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:38,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if they switch and we have different format types.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

245
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:44,243
[SPEAKER_05]: If the modern treasury thing would...

246
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care of that, that would be nice.

247
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:47,770
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be nice.

248
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:53,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems more likely than any of the other ones I've looked at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah. 

249
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:01,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you're...

250
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:04,425
[SPEAKER_00]: This side, project, finance, hand.

251
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:08,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Sai called it a side quest.

252
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:12,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that related to that issue that you put in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

253
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday?

254
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:14,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

255
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:18,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It started on Thursday and I made the ticket Friday because it

256
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:20,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Carried it into Friday and now it's carrying it into Monday.

257
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:24,203
[SPEAKER_03]: That's super helpful though.

258
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:30,193
[SPEAKER_03]: could put stuff in there like Jordan called and it just sends you a team's message and send you an email and

259
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:32,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all good.

260
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:33,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't have to have him under.

261
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:36,859
[SPEAKER_03]: him on there as a stakeholder so he doesn't get bombed.

262
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

263
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:41,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, I was like, oh, this is just the one-off.

264
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:45,600
[SPEAKER_02]: They just wanted to generate a file and they called it like...

265
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,297
[SPEAKER_02]: 2:45 and they're like, hey, can we get this by four?

266
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:50,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh yes, I actually do a pull.

267
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:54,915
[SPEAKER_02]: request for some reason and

268
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't make a ticket, but then it carried in, so yeah.

269
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I just made it an issue.

270
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's fine.

271
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:03,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

272
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:05,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on you.

273
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:05,866
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a bug.

274
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:07,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a...

275
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:09,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a new app.

276
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:11,216
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an issue, I guess.

277
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:13,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

278
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:26,505
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if CK has talked to you at all, Chris, but he was

279
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:29,796
[SPEAKER_00]: He demoed me his...

280
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:33,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart Bear Replacement app.

281
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:34,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah?

282
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:34,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

283
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,905
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's pretty simple right now.

284
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:39,043
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them a couple,

285
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:45,287
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions, pointers on the UI side of things.

286
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's...

287
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,746
[SPEAKER_00]: He's getting to where he thinks we can get out of Smart Bear eventually.

288
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:56,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not this year, but yeah.

289
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:57,065
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking good.

290
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:01,234
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would take one thing off of our books.

291
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,608
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, once it gets to a good place to show you what it does and looks like, we'll show them too.

292
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:13,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?

293
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:16,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Def con next week.

294
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:18,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week?

295
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:18,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

296
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:21,840
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Thursday, or sorry, Tuesday through?

297
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll leave Tuesday and fly back Monday.

298
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:28,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Natalie going to that?

299
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:29,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

300
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:35,276
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah there's like five, six? 

301
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:37,549
[SPEAKER_01]: There's us two.

302
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane and Jake.

303
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:43,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Stevie and Natalie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stevie and Natalie.

304
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any facts?

305
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:52,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I have several small facts.

306
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I could not think of it as a big one.

307
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:59,757
[SPEAKER_06]: But one, this is more practical than interesting, but

308
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:05,747
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the detergent that you get, it comes with like a cup and it's got like

309
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,565
[SPEAKER_06]: the loads on it or whatever.

310
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, modern washers,

311
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,033
[SPEAKER_06]: you only need like one tablespoon and they

312
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:20,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what they recommend that is probably like at least five tablespoons for like the one

313
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:24,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're ripping you off, basically.

314
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're also...

315
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:30,469
[SPEAKER_00]: like destroying the washers when you do it too, if you do too much.

316
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,924
[SPEAKER_06]: The second one is male black widow spiders don't

317
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:36,541
[SPEAKER_06]: look like black widow spiders.

318
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:38,704
[SPEAKER_06]: They're small, they're like that big.

319
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:43,648
[SPEAKER_06]: But the way you can, if you ever see a small spider like about that big,

320
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:49,352
[SPEAKER_06]: that has white, black, yellow, and red stripes on the back.

321
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:53,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a male black widow spider.

322
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they poisonous like the females?

323
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:58,363
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as I know, yeah.

324
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:02,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Ant Mill, this one.

325
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:05,940
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be depressing if they weren't just ants and termites,

326
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, wherever they go, they leave

327
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:12,403
[SPEAKER_06]: a trail and the trail evaporates.

328
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,407
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the route is good,

329
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:21,212
[SPEAKER_06]: and a lot of ants are using it, the trail doesn't evaporate and it's stronger because they keep going.

330
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:26,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if one amp loops back through the original trail

331
00:18:26,862 --> 00:18:32,620
[SPEAKER_06]: and enough ants start doing that, it will cause what's called an ant mill.

332
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,231
[SPEAKER_06]: where they basically just go in a circle until they die.

333
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:39,488
[SPEAKER_06]: and they pile up like piles of them.

334
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:40,895
[SPEAKER_06]: and it doesn't stop.

335
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:45,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And each time another ant comes along, it just strengthens the trail.

336
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:52,195
[SPEAKER_06]: The last one is about poison dart frogs.

337
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,186
[SPEAKER_06]: They have

338
00:18:55,617 --> 00:19:00,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if it might actually be poison, either poison or venom on their skin.

339
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:05,490
[SPEAKER_06]: and that can be used to make Dart sense of name.

340
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,977
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I didn't know

341
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:11,938
[SPEAKER_06]: is that they obtain or they develop that poison

342
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:15,988
[SPEAKER_06]: from the food that they consume.

343
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:18,688
[SPEAKER_06]: you can get them in pet stores

344
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:23,785
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're safe because they're not eating those like that.

345
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:28,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming it's like bullet ants, which are like really

346
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:33,167
[SPEAKER_06]: powerful ants in jungle climates, but

347
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:39,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how much they were, less than $50, but you can get them at like PetSmart or whatever.

348
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:43,697
[SPEAKER_06]: So long as you don't have bullet ants you should be fine.

349
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,137
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what they were eating?

350
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:46,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it bullet ants?

351 
# This should not be here 
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:46,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullet ants?

352
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:49,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably bullet ants.

353
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:54,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost certain bullet ants, but probably a variety of things.

354
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:58,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen videos at the bullet ants.

355
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:01,905
[SPEAKER_06]: When we were in Costa Rica,

356
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:05,363
[SPEAKER_06]: For our cruise, we saw one of those bullpen ants.

357
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:06,549
[SPEAKER_06]: They're huge.

358
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,896
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like that big.

359
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:13,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you can or they probably do make some kind of a

360
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:18,578
[SPEAKER_03]: simulate or collect that scent that those ants make.

361
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:25,176
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe you could you can put it somewhere and make them go somewhere that would be

362
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:28,355
[SPEAKER_06]: You know...
[SPEAKER_03]: way to control your hands in your house?

363
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:30,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had

364
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:35,048
[SPEAKER_06]: a professor, Dr. Zhang, at SEMO

365
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,883
[SPEAKER_06]: that tried that.

366
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:39,604
[SPEAKER_06]: He said he had an ant problem at his desk.

367
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:45,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what he was doing, but he tried to use their own pheromones to rob them, but he said it didn't work.

368 
# This was never said. 
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:46,928
[SPEAKER_01]: America.

369
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:54,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, you need anything?

370
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,491
[SPEAKER_05]: No, good. I did schedule a couple of meetings this afternoon that i invited you to

371
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:01,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll call you later, though.

372
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:04,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that for today?

373
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:05,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

374
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:05,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

375
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:07,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know if it was for Friday or today.

376
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:09,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I sent them on Friday for today.

377
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:13,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I invited Ethan too because I thought he'd be back. 
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. Yeah.

378
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:19,513
[SPEAKER_05]: We can talk and see if we just want to be us or if we want to like loop Jacob in or somebody else.

379
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:21,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

380
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:22,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'll work.

381 
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

382
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:28,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to go to the main office after this but I'll call you after that.

383
00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:29,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that'll work.

384
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:33,490
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's all I got.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

385
00:21:33,511 --> 00:21:33,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.
