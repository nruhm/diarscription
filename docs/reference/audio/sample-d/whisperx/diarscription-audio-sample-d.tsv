start	end	text
11253	12300	Well, it's quiet.
14172	15863	Everything's stopped.
16552	17383	Thank you.
19117	20609	It's all Stacy's fault.
20629	21112	My fault?
21254	21556	Yeah.
21697	22161	What'd I do?
22382	23027	I don't know.
23088	24418	Everybody was talking until you came in.
24854	28753	Technically it was me.
28974	30763	I think I did.
33494	36071	You're the first person to know this.
36091	39353	Oh yeah that's cool.
39333	43656	Well, apparently it is the year of the snake in Chinese.
43636	48364	calendar and so Xenia Optical like did a snake
48344	52937	Basically they have like four or five glasses with little snakes on the sides.
52917	56498	We got our fact of the day pre-teaser.
56478	59805	Do you have a, is it, is it?
59785	61013	It's red.
61295	63771	So is it like blue light protected?
63751	66505	You know, I think it's a gimmick.
66525	69762	I just like the fact that it kind of looks like
69742	71010	The...
71598	75235	Cyclops from the X-Men had like those red glasses.
75296	77305	But supposedly they said like
77285	80410	protects you from security cameras because
80390	85708	they'll just see like red and then they won't be able to do facial recognition.
85688	86880	I think that's a given.
86901	88073	Something going on with the meeting?
88093	88780	Hi, Chris.
88760	92610	He said that you guys are muted.
92590	97875	Yeah, I think you hit it like as soon as you started it.
97855	103343	I think it's probably because like the AI companion thing whenever it was on it shows it was muted and I guess maybe
103323	105655	I tried to help you.
108858	110285	Well, I guess we can get started.
110346	110728	It's 9-0-1.
112175	114447	Yay.
115372	119357	As we all know, Adam is having some
121379	126799	health issues so he's getting checked out so be thinking about him praying about him
127775	131929	And other than that, I don't think there's anything.
131909	135574	new going on in my world, so.
136432	142172	I'm just sitting over there taking notes and routing phone calls.
142152	147792	Let me just go around counterclockwise today.
148227	151774	You sent Kevin an order out on the...
151754	155588	Friday with just kind of a hodgepodge of faces.
156057	158305	Smaller stove.
159078	164295	Probably have Blake working on another one this week.
164275	169830	He should be good to go on
169810	174893	I think most of the common issues is what we're going to.
180712	185997	bigger release with designer and cabin order and the builder service.
193655	197205	When do you owe me from Vegas?
197226	197407	Tomorrow.
197427	197508	Wow.
197528	198113	Two hours ago.
198093	203142	Jake.
203527	208693	Are you guys going to be able to hit the Slack channel while you're there?
209062	212541	I mean as long as we have time.
212521	218532	well right yeah it'd be cool like you can't actually you're on the floor and
218512	223645	They're like really strict about pictures.
223625	229264	and stuff, so you can't really take pictures unless you're in a photo area.
229244	230291	Really?
230311	233010	I guess like there's enough.
232990	237246	like between like feds and
237614	241549	borderline criminal and I guess like full blown criminal hackers that
241529	246122	do come to it, like just, I guess, people that are super strict about their privacy.
246305	251404	right yeah somebody sees you like taking a picture they can go to like
251384	254792	The people that work there will be like, hey, they were taking a picture.
255296	256163	They'll be like, oh...
256514	258247	See they need these red glasses.
258630	260162	That's right, yeah.
260142	265967	I bet there's some people running around in there too that have the infrared build things going on there.
265947	268038	Don't mask out their faces.
268561	270993	Didn't you say you met the guy from Darknet Diaries?
271114	271958	Yeah.
271938	274901	Two years ago, we met.
275304	277138	His name was Ghost Exodus.
277118	280176	And we met him there.
280156	282270	Yeah, he has an episode of Dark Knight Diaries.
282290	285289	He went to prison for a little while.
285269	289018	basically he worked for this healthcare like
289252	294267	a smaller thing, but they had locked down his computer.
294247	298215	So he just remoted into one of the servers and
298195	301236	was doing stuff from there.
301216	305353	know if he was even IT, but he just found a way to get into their server
305333	310568	VMs and then was just doing stuff from there.
310548	314584	The Fed guy, he like posted on him.
314564	320575	YouTube or something about how he was hacking like making it play up like he was doing more than what he was
320555	325789	This fed agent was trying to make a name for itself, so they threw the hammer.
325769	330514	and all he was really doing was remoting into something on prim.
330494	335121	But since it was medical services and stuff.
335101	339627	He was like the runner of this hacker group.
339607	343788	You went to prison for like 50 meters or something.
344009	345617	Yeah, it was crazy.
345597	348441	Yeah, it was like, wow.
349067	350055	People get up.
350035	351062	with less for murder.
351646	352250	Yeah.
352834	353499	That's crazy.
354667	355472	Yeah, you really got it.
356718	359556	You can't get the best end of the stick.
360211	362207	He's a nice guy funny enough.
362227	362328	Yeah.
363053	364162	Most of them are, I think.
364323	364787	Yeah.
365965	367272	What you got going on, Greg?
367292	371272	You and Stevie were talking about something this morning really interesting.
371554	371976	Oh, yeah.
371956	372669	So,
373492	375829	Yeah, she's just working on the embedded devices.
375849	378468	We don't have anything to deliver yet for that.
378669	378810	Uh-huh.
378790	382489	We do have an application hub, Chris.
383026	387973	we're going to turn over to testing and then probably a consolidate this one.
389455	390404	That's what we say.
394923	397947	I don't have any releases, but
397927	402165	I've been looking on my side quest about ACH transfers.
402145	405962	I reached out to a company and they were like,
405942	411953	Yeah, we really would like there to be at least 10,000 transactions a month.
411933	415608	Then they just didn't reply to me after that.
415911	416577	Wow.
416810	421181	I think we give about 7,500 transactions a month.
421201	422128	So you're only...
422108	423116	Right there.
424124	426786	We really want at least $5,000
426766	429738	and 10,000 plus transactions.
429758	430465	And I was like,
431002	436472	Yeah, I was like $500,000 is not any problem at all.
436452	439408	And then they just didn't reply.
439669	442243	That's pretty dull on their part, because the cash.
442223	447154	Well, I think what it is is with an ACH
447539	452149	it's so cheap to process they don't do like a percentage or anything so it's really like
452129	455322	they make their money off different transactions which
455909	457517	I'm sure they just group at all.
458623	461920	They wouldn't even tell me the pricing or anything, so I'm back on the search.
461900	466560	I wonder if they would change their mind if we told them that you know we're
466540	470458	Planning on having higher volume eventually because I think Jeff
470438	475369	wants all of our vendor ACH to eventually be, or vendors to be ACHs.
475349	479065	It's kind of like trying it out with some right now.
479045	481159	and try to reach out maybe again.
481884	484482	There's actually a payment bill at DEF CON
484462	488110	So I'm gonna go cruise around there and see if there's like
488090	491788	anybody has tips on good secure
492190	498167	Just don't get a tip from some criminal hacker.
498147	500100	Yeah, definitely.
500442	503905	It's like, oh, have you heard of this URL?
503885	509895	I happen to be the man in the middle on that but we're not saying yeah I think I would do some research when I got back but at least
509875	512488	Maybe somebody could point me.
512508	512933	Oh, God.
512954	513237	Yeah.
513503	516527	You just can't seem to get your
516507	518456	out of finance, can you?
518577	519531	It just keeps pulling you back.
519511	523125	Especially when Ethan was gone last week.
523105	528340	Jeff and Jordan just decided to start calling me again, willy-nilly.
528320	531723	And then Chris asked me to look into that ACH transfer.
531884	532508	Yeah.
532488	535512	I feel bad because me and...
535492	541502	Chandler like right on the cusp of being able to release this thing we've been working on for like a month and a half too
541482	546227	and then I'm like, all right, well, I'm gonna be looking at this.
546207	547796	What's this thing you're working on?
548098	550050	That logistics.
550271	551458	Oh yeah.
551438	556572	Multiplayer, it's like right there, just like finally.
556552	557626	Doing final touches.
557667	559288	So you wanted to do multi?
559775	564638	So that if two people are using logistics, they won't stomp on each other.
564618	565546	Yeah, exactly.
565586	569177	So each time something happens it will refresh from the API.
569157	574425	This is apparently refreshing, really screw stuff up right now.
574405	578813	where Jason explains it, I don't know exactly, but...
578793	581851	But this is the CAD part for Jason, right?
581871	582234	Yeah.
582455	584145	This isn't...
584513	587622	This isn't what Janelle uses.
587602	593393	Yeah, because Janelle is the only one that uses it, so she probably wouldn't really benefit from
593373	596991	No, there's a few others that use it, but it already has a feature like that.
597273	599383	I don't know how they...
599363	602910	CNC tab ended up in logistics.
602890	608310	He was just a place to put it in.
608611	611533	That's kind of what I figured the logistics has.
611783	616360	for the stuff Janelle uses, it has some concurrency like that.
616677	619515	if one person moves an order into the load,
620693	626586	they could send a message and it moves that order into that load on all their machines too.
627224	629661	It's really hard to test that stuff, isn't it Chris?
630225	632762	Like concurrency parts and things like that?
633181	636003	Yeah, we'd have to have two different ones going at once.
636124	636728	Right.
639205	641959	That gives us to Ethan.
642614	647038	Because for us, we've just been focused on Checksmith.
647018	650987	We're getting pretty close to finishing up the reconciled piece.
650967	656978	Hopefully this week we'll wrap it up and be able to set it to testing and run through.
656958	657351	Bye.
661750	667575	On our end, recently we did website releases that
667555	669003	It was, I think, last week.
669023	671718	But there was four minor text change.
671879	673448	And Natalie has done accessibility.
673428	676890	changes for the website,
677495	682105	I think I sent, I can't quite remember, but I think I sent customer portal to testing
682473	687488	So maybe this week we could have a release in just a minute.
687468	688670	It depends on that course.
694150	697849	And that was for, I think,
697829	702557	I don't know exactly what it was, but it had something to do with bill paid changes.
703955	706490	or on your end, I think.
706550	708683	They remember something like that, I don't know.
708663	713188	I don't know all the details because Matt's been talking with her more about it.
713168	714577	But I see if they're in here.
715322	715604	Yeah.
716269	719027	So once she's ready to push that out, we just gotta...
719007	722942	push the payment processing API.
726972	732983	It might be interesting to create some kind of a diagram where this hooks to this, hooks to this,
732963	735801	So this is, you know, between
736355	739648	between Andrew's team and your team.
739966	742647	order entry, how all those talk to each other.
742667	744643	I might do that.
744623	746213	I'm gonna work on that
746918	752288	So if I teams you or something pestering you about that, that's probably what it's about.
752268	754339	I'm probably trying to draw pictures.
754742	757215	It would be cool to have a full program.
757195	761144	Because everything starts in orders and then it traces through.
761588	762615	Like a map.
762595	763843	Yeah, yeah.
763863	768252	Like one of those, what's the guy from the TV show that has like the wall?
768232	770813	From It's Always Sunny.
770974	772909	Yeah.
772889	774039	Pick me Sylvia.
774160	774967	Sylvia Scott.
775714	777550	I was like, wait a second.
778542	781357	Got any facts?
781558	784553	I have two they're both AI facts.
784533	790510	there was a leak, I suspect that they did it themselves,
790490	794998	but that showed how much the AI people in Meta are getting.
795164	796922	And I think they did it themselves.
797290	802221	or I suspect because they are trying to basically poach all of the
802201	807975	developers, but apparently at least five of them are
807955	811890	They all got $10 million signing bonuses.
812022	815282	No, excuse me, $100 million signing bonuses
815262	818653	and are making 10 million a year apiece.
819360	819703	Wow.
820477	826285	And then the second fact is well, it's not really a fact or of an announcement but
826265	832073	Chapter 85 is supposed to be released this week, like Thursday or Friday.
832711	838722	I read something this morning about Apple working on their own AI.
838702	838978	you
839512	841964	It's been Siri for years.
841984	845522	I'm thinking, OK, it's either going to be called IAI
845502	847960	or they're just gonna make Siri smarter.
848645	849370	I don't know.
849350	852880	well before and I thought this was really lame but
852860	858398	They tried to just call it AI, but make the A Apple.
858378	862195	So Apple intelligence and they just call it AI.
862175	864594	AI is ready to take it.
865158	865823	Right.
868688	870920	A bit late to the game there.
871403	872107	Yeah, they are.
872127	873957	They really are.
874358	877382	Of course, the technology is already developed now.
877632	880896	they can kind of piggyback off of what's already out there, I guess.
881359	883575	Yeah, even Snapchat has an A on it.
883555	884841	Thank you.
887538	891979	So Blake's here, and you all have to see Andrea.
892381	897784	Today he's gone, but he'll be gone here the rest of the week.
897764	899084	It should be over.
900785	903447	So is Blake going to be the only one on your team that's here?
903810	905665	Yeah, he should be the only one.
906151	911132	If not, I won't bring my laptop, but um...
912310	917545	Text me in probably the easiest way to make sure I see it.
917565	918169	Okay.
918689	923115	So you got your number in the emergency contacts thing, right?
923135	924362	Yeah, it should be on...
928831	929371	SharePoint.
929392	930016	SharePoint.
931345	932913	I always forget the name of that.
934944	937356	I've copied the
937336	941355	SharePoint contacts into the
941335	946587	Confluence pages for JIRA, they're all kind of
946567	948378	Confluence Jura, yeah.
948941	952543	So I've got those contacts in there so I know where they are so I don't have to go hunting
952523	955463	SharePoint, so that's helpful.
956455	961504	Last Thursday when Jordan was like freaking out about permissions and everything.
961484	963056	He's like, do you have Adam's number?
963137	964326	I was like, yeah.
964488	965314	He's like, can I have it?
965334	966060	I'm like, uh.
966040	970296	Yeah, that's a touchy place.
970276	972803	Wait, did I say I have it?
972823	974177	I guess I have deleted it.
974157	976127	I was like, what do you need it for?
976147	977514	He's like, I'm trying to find permission.
977534	980168	I was like, hold on, we're talking to Chris right now.
980755	986361	I don't have permissions, but yeah, Jordan was like, he was like trying to move way faster though.
986341	989061	what it was actually
990492	994275	If anybody needs any supplies, let me know.
994255	998865	Is anybody else going to be out just well?
998845	1002460	Yeah, it would be a bad week to be gone because everybody's going to DEF CON.
1002440	1008450	I will say my girlfriend's mother is having
1008430	1011538	age and heart-related issues.
1011518	1016230	If something were to happen, I might be out, but I don't think anything will happen.
1016210	1019875	I'll throw a few prayers your way too.
1019855	1022890	Adam was supposed to be out Friday with all this going on.
1022910	1025342	I don't know if he's still leaving him up.
1025322	1027316	How's he feeling today?
1027497	1028786	I was with him yesterday.
1028806	1030135	He was his normal self.

1031952	1034455	My mom, she had...
1034435	1035723	Kind of the same thing.
1035743	1037996	She had chest pains and went in for a stress test.
1038016	1040209	She was on the treadmill for like 10 days.
1040189	1044968	seconds and they saw stuff rushed her to the ER she had a triple bypass
1044948	1045412	Wow.
1045553	1046158	And she was 45.
1046219	1049386	So all of this is in the back of Adam's head.

1053200	1055601	and then he's supposed to meet with the doctor at 12 o'clock.
1055924	1058164	So if they don't see anything,
1058144	1060338	They did give him blood pressure medicine.
1060378	1063277	They think that's what it is, high blood pressure.
