WEBVTT

00:11.253 --> 00:12.300
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's quiet.

00:14.172 --> 00:15.863
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's stopped.

00:16.552 --> 00:17.383
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

00:19.117 --> 00:20.609
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all Stacy's fault.

00:20.629 --> 00:21.112
[SPEAKER_01]: My fault?

00:21.254 --> 00:21.556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

00:21.697 --> 00:22.161
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd I do?

00:22.382 --> 00:23.027
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

00:23.088 --> 00:24.418
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was talking until you came in.

00:24.854 --> 00:28.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically it was me.

00:28.974 --> 00:30.763
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did.

00:33.494 --> 00:36.071
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the first person to know this.

00:36.091 --> 00:39.353
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah that's cool.

00:39.333 --> 00:43.656
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently it is the year of the snake in Chinese.

00:43.636 --> 00:48.364
[SPEAKER_01]: calendar and so Xenia Optical like did a snake

00:48.344 --> 00:52.937
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically they have like four or five glasses with little snakes on the sides.

00:52.917 --> 00:56.498
[SPEAKER_05]: We got our fact of the day pre-teaser.

00:56.478 --> 00:59.805
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a, is it, is it?

00:59.785 --> 01:01.013
[SPEAKER_00]: It's red.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.771
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it like blue light protected?

01:03.751 --> 01:06.505
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's a gimmick.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.762
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like the fact that it kind of looks like

01:09.742 --> 01:11.010
[SPEAKER_01]: The...

01:11.598 --> 01:15.235
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyclops from the X-Men had like those red glasses.

01:15.296 --> 01:17.305
[SPEAKER_01]: But supposedly they said like

01:17.285 --> 01:20.410
[SPEAKER_01]: protects you from security cameras because

01:20.390 --> 01:25.708
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll just see like red and then they won't be able to do facial recognition.

01:25.688 --> 01:26.880
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a given.

01:26.901 --> 01:28.073
[SPEAKER_07]: Something going on with the meeting?

01:28.093 --> 01:28.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Chris.

01:28.760 --> 01:32.610
[SPEAKER_07]: He said that you guys are muted.

01:32.590 --> 01:37.875
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think you hit it like as soon as you started it.

01:37.855 --> 01:43.343
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's probably because like the AI companion thing whenever it was on it shows it was muted and I guess maybe

01:43.323 --> 01:45.655
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to help you.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.285
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess we can get started.

01:50.346 --> 01:50.728
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 9-0-1.

01:52.175 --> 01:54.447
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

01:55.372 --> 01:59.357
[SPEAKER_05]: As we all know, Adam is having some

02:01.379 --> 02:06.799
[SPEAKER_05]: health issues so he's getting checked out so be thinking about him praying about him

02:07.775 --> 02:11.929
[SPEAKER_05]: And other than that, I don't think there's anything.

02:11.909 --> 02:15.574
[SPEAKER_05]: new going on in my world, so.

02:16.432 --> 02:22.172
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just sitting over there taking notes and routing phone calls.

02:22.152 --> 02:27.792
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just go around counterclockwise today.

02:28.227 --> 02:31.774
[SPEAKER_06]: You sent Kevin an order out on the...

02:31.754 --> 02:35.588
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday with just kind of a hodgepodge of faces.

02:36.057 --> 02:38.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Smaller stove.

02:39.078 --> 02:44.295
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably have Blake working on another one this week.

02:44.275 --> 02:49.830
[SPEAKER_06]: He should be good to go on

02:49.810 --> 02:54.893
[SPEAKER_06]: I think most of the common issues is what we're going to.

03:00.712 --> 03:05.997
[SPEAKER_06]: bigger release with designer and cabin order and the builder service.

03:13.655 --> 03:17.205
[SPEAKER_04]: When do you owe me from Vegas?

03:17.226 --> 03:17.407
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow.

03:17.427 --> 03:17.508
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

03:17.528 --> 03:18.113
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours ago.

03:18.093 --> 03:23.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Jake.

03:23.527 --> 03:28.693
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys going to be able to hit the Slack channel while you're there?

03:29.062 --> 03:32.541
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean as long as we have time.

03:32.521 --> 03:38.532
[SPEAKER_05]: well right yeah it'd be cool like you can't actually you're on the floor and

03:38.512 --> 03:43.645
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like really strict about pictures.

03:43.625 --> 03:49.264
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff, so you can't really take pictures unless you're in a photo area.

03:49.244 --> 03:50.291
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

03:50.311 --> 03:53.010
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess like there's enough.

03:52.990 --> 03:57.246
[SPEAKER_06]: like between like feds and

03:57.614 --> 04:01.549
[SPEAKER_06]: borderline criminal and I guess like full blown criminal hackers that

04:01.529 --> 04:06.122
[SPEAKER_06]: do come to it, like just, I guess, people that are super strict about their privacy.

04:06.305 --> 04:11.404
[SPEAKER_04]: right yeah somebody sees you like taking a picture they can go to like

04:11.384 --> 04:14.792
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that work there will be like, hey, they were taking a picture.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.163
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be like, oh...

04:16.514 --> 04:18.247
[SPEAKER_04]: See they need these red glasses.

04:18.630 --> 04:20.162
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, yeah.

04:20.142 --> 04:25.967
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet there's some people running around in there too that have the infrared build things going on there.

04:25.947 --> 04:28.038
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't mask out their faces.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.993
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't you say you met the guy from Darknet Diaries?

04:31.114 --> 04:31.958
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.901
[SPEAKER_04]: Two years ago, we met.

04:35.304 --> 04:37.138
[SPEAKER_04]: His name was Ghost Exodus.

04:37.118 --> 04:40.176
[SPEAKER_04]: And we met him there.

04:40.156 --> 04:42.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he has an episode of Dark Knight Diaries.

04:42.290 --> 04:45.289
[SPEAKER_04]: He went to prison for a little while.

04:45.269 --> 04:49.018
[SPEAKER_04]: basically he worked for this healthcare like

04:49.252 --> 04:54.267
[SPEAKER_04]: a smaller thing, but they had locked down his computer.

04:54.247 --> 04:58.215
[SPEAKER_04]: So he just remoted into one of the servers and

04:58.195 --> 05:01.236
[SPEAKER_04]: was doing stuff from there.

05:01.216 --> 05:05.353
[SPEAKER_04]: know if he was even IT, but he just found a way to get into their server

05:05.333 --> 05:10.568
[SPEAKER_04]: VMs and then was just doing stuff from there.

05:10.548 --> 05:14.584
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fed guy, he like posted on him.

05:14.564 --> 05:20.575
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube or something about how he was hacking like making it play up like he was doing more than what he was

05:20.555 --> 05:25.789
[SPEAKER_04]: This fed agent was trying to make a name for itself, so they threw the hammer.

05:25.769 --> 05:30.514
[SPEAKER_04]: and all he was really doing was remoting into something on prim.

05:30.494 --> 05:35.121
[SPEAKER_04]: But since it was medical services and stuff.

05:35.101 --> 05:39.627
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like the runner of this hacker group.

05:39.607 --> 05:43.788
[SPEAKER_04]: You went to prison for like 50 meters or something.

05:44.009 --> 05:45.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was crazy.

05:45.597 --> 05:48.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was like, wow.

05:49.067 --> 05:50.055
[SPEAKER_07]: People get up.

05:50.035 --> 05:51.062
[SPEAKER_07]: with less for murder.

05:51.646 --> 05:52.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

05:52.834 --> 05:53.499
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

05:54.667 --> 05:55.472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you really got it.

05:56.718 --> 05:59.556
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get the best end of the stick.

06:00.211 --> 06:02.207
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a nice guy funny enough.

06:02.227 --> 06:02.328
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

06:03.053 --> 06:04.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them are, I think.

06:04.323 --> 06:04.787
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

06:05.965 --> 06:07.272
[SPEAKER_05]: What you got going on, Greg?

06:07.292 --> 06:11.272
[SPEAKER_05]: You and Stevie were talking about something this morning really interesting.

06:11.554 --> 06:11.976
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

06:11.956 --> 06:12.669
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

06:13.492 --> 06:15.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's just working on the embedded devices.

06:15.849 --> 06:18.468
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have anything to deliver yet for that.

06:18.669 --> 06:18.810
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

06:18.790 --> 06:22.489
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have an application hub, Chris.

06:23.026 --> 06:27.973
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to turn over to testing and then probably a consolidate this one.

06:29.455 --> 06:30.404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we say.

06:34.923 --> 06:37.947
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any releases, but

06:37.927 --> 06:42.165
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been looking on my side quest about ACH transfers.

06:42.145 --> 06:45.962
[SPEAKER_04]: I reached out to a company and they were like,

06:45.942 --> 06:51.953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we really would like there to be at least 10,000 transactions a month.

06:51.933 --> 06:55.608
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they just didn't reply to me after that.

06:55.911 --> 06:56.577
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

06:56.810 --> 07:01.181
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we give about 7,500 transactions a month.

07:01.201 --> 07:02.128
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're only...

07:02.108 --> 07:03.116
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.786
[SPEAKER_04]: We really want at least $5,000

07:06.766 --> 07:09.738
[SPEAKER_04]: and 10,000 plus transactions.

07:09.758 --> 07:10.465
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like,

07:11.002 --> 07:16.472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was like $500,000 is not any problem at all.

07:16.452 --> 07:19.408
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they just didn't reply.

07:19.669 --> 07:22.243
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty dull on their part, because the cash.

07:22.223 --> 07:27.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what it is is with an ACH

07:27.539 --> 07:32.149
[SPEAKER_04]: it's so cheap to process they don't do like a percentage or anything so it's really like

07:32.129 --> 07:35.322
[SPEAKER_04]: they make their money off different transactions which

07:35.909 --> 07:37.517
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they just group at all.

07:38.623 --> 07:41.920
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't even tell me the pricing or anything, so I'm back on the search.

07:41.900 --> 07:46.560
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if they would change their mind if we told them that you know we're

07:46.540 --> 07:50.458
[SPEAKER_07]: Planning on having higher volume eventually because I think Jeff

07:50.438 --> 07:55.369
[SPEAKER_07]: wants all of our vendor ACH to eventually be, or vendors to be ACHs.

07:55.349 --> 07:59.065
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like trying it out with some right now.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.159
[SPEAKER_04]: and try to reach out maybe again.

08:01.884 --> 08:04.482
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a payment bill at DEF CON

08:04.462 --> 08:08.110
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna go cruise around there and see if there's like

08:08.090 --> 08:11.788
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody has tips on good secure

08:12.190 --> 08:18.167
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't get a tip from some criminal hacker.

08:18.147 --> 08:20.100
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.

08:20.442 --> 08:23.905
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, have you heard of this URL?

08:23.885 --> 08:29.895
[SPEAKER_05]: I happen to be the man in the middle on that but we're not saying yeah I think I would do some research when I got back but at least

08:29.875 --> 08:32.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe somebody could point me.

08:32.508 --> 08:32.933
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

08:32.954 --> 08:33.237
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

08:33.503 --> 08:36.527
[SPEAKER_05]: You just can't seem to get your

08:36.507 --> 08:38.456
[SPEAKER_05]: out of finance, can you?

08:38.577 --> 08:39.531
[SPEAKER_05]: It just keeps pulling you back.

08:39.511 --> 08:43.125
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when Ethan was gone last week.

08:43.105 --> 08:48.340
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff and Jordan just decided to start calling me again, willy-nilly.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.723
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Chris asked me to look into that ACH transfer.

08:51.884 --> 08:52.508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

08:52.488 --> 08:55.512
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel bad because me and...

08:55.492 --> 09:01.502
[SPEAKER_04]: Chandler like right on the cusp of being able to release this thing we've been working on for like a month and a half too

09:01.482 --> 09:06.227
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I'm like, all right, well, I'm gonna be looking at this.

09:06.207 --> 09:07.796
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this thing you're working on?

09:08.098 --> 09:10.050
[SPEAKER_04]: That logistics.

09:10.271 --> 09:11.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

09:11.438 --> 09:16.572
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiplayer, it's like right there, just like finally.

09:16.552 --> 09:17.626
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing final touches.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.288
[SPEAKER_05]: So you wanted to do multi?

09:19.775 --> 09:24.638
[SPEAKER_05]: So that if two people are using logistics, they won't stomp on each other.

09:24.618 --> 09:25.546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

09:25.586 --> 09:29.177
[SPEAKER_04]: So each time something happens it will refresh from the API.

09:29.157 --> 09:34.425
[SPEAKER_04]: This is apparently refreshing, really screw stuff up right now.

09:34.405 --> 09:38.813
[SPEAKER_04]: where Jason explains it, I don't know exactly, but...

09:38.793 --> 09:41.851
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the CAD part for Jason, right?

09:41.871 --> 09:42.234
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

09:42.455 --> 09:44.145
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't...

09:44.513 --> 09:47.622
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't what Janelle uses.

09:47.602 --> 09:53.393
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because Janelle is the only one that uses it, so she probably wouldn't really benefit from

09:53.373 --> 09:56.991
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's a few others that use it, but it already has a feature like that.

09:57.273 --> 09:59.383
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how they...

09:59.363 --> 10:02.910
[SPEAKER_04]: CNC tab ended up in logistics.

10:02.890 --> 10:08.310
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just a place to put it in.

10:08.611 --> 10:11.533
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what I figured the logistics has.

10:11.783 --> 10:16.360
[SPEAKER_06]: for the stuff Janelle uses, it has some concurrency like that.

10:16.677 --> 10:19.515
[SPEAKER_06]: if one person moves an order into the load,

10:20.693 --> 10:26.586
[SPEAKER_06]: they could send a message and it moves that order into that load on all their machines too.

10:27.224 --> 10:29.661
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard to test that stuff, isn't it Chris?

10:30.225 --> 10:32.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Like concurrency parts and things like that?

10:33.181 --> 10:36.003
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'd have to have two different ones going at once.

10:36.124 --> 10:36.728
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.959
[SPEAKER_07]: That gives us to Ethan.

10:42.614 --> 10:47.038
[SPEAKER_07]: Because for us, we've just been focused on Checksmith.

10:47.018 --> 10:50.987
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting pretty close to finishing up the reconciled piece.

10:50.967 --> 10:56.978
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully this week we'll wrap it up and be able to set it to testing and run through.

10:56.958 --> 10:57.351
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

11:01.750 --> 11:07.575
[SPEAKER_01]: On our end, recently we did website releases that

11:07.555 --> 11:09.003
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I think, last week.

11:09.023 --> 11:11.718
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was four minor text change.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.448
[SPEAKER_01]: And Natalie has done accessibility.

11:13.428 --> 11:16.890
[SPEAKER_01]: changes for the website,

11:17.495 --> 11:22.105
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I sent, I can't quite remember, but I think I sent customer portal to testing

11:22.473 --> 11:27.488
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe this week we could have a release in just a minute.

11:27.468 --> 11:28.670
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on that course.

11:34.150 --> 11:37.849
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was for, I think,

11:37.829 --> 11:42.557
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what it was, but it had something to do with bill paid changes.

11:43.955 --> 11:46.490
[SPEAKER_01]: or on your end, I think.

11:46.550 --> 11:48.683
[SPEAKER_07]: They remember something like that, I don't know.

11:48.663 --> 11:53.188
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know all the details because Matt's been talking with her more about it.

11:53.168 --> 11:54.577
[SPEAKER_07]: But I see if they're in here.

11:55.322 --> 11:55.604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

11:56.269 --> 11:59.027
[SPEAKER_07]: So once she's ready to push that out, we just gotta...

11:59.007 --> 12:02.942
[SPEAKER_07]: push the payment processing API.

12:06.972 --> 12:12.983
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be interesting to create some kind of a diagram where this hooks to this, hooks to this,

12:12.963 --> 12:15.801
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is, you know, between

12:16.355 --> 12:19.648
[SPEAKER_05]: between Andrew's team and your team.

12:19.966 --> 12:22.647
[SPEAKER_05]: order entry, how all those talk to each other.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.643
[SPEAKER_05]: I might do that.

12:24.623 --> 12:26.213
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna work on that

12:26.918 --> 12:32.288
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I teams you or something pestering you about that, that's probably what it's about.

12:32.268 --> 12:34.339
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably trying to draw pictures.

12:34.742 --> 12:37.215
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be cool to have a full program.

12:37.195 --> 12:41.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everything starts in orders and then it traces through.

12:41.588 --> 12:42.615
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a map.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

12:43.863 --> 12:48.252
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one of those, what's the guy from the TV show that has like the wall?

12:48.232 --> 12:50.813
[SPEAKER_04]: From It's Always Sunny.

12:50.974 --> 12:52.909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

12:52.889 --> 12:54.039
[SPEAKER_07]: Pick me Sylvia.

12:54.160 --> 12:54.967
[SPEAKER_03]: Sylvia Scott.

12:55.714 --> 12:57.550
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, wait a second.

12:58.542 --> 13:01.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Got any facts?

13:01.558 --> 13:04.553
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two they're both AI facts.

13:04.533 --> 13:10.510
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a leak, I suspect that they did it themselves,

13:10.490 --> 13:14.998
[SPEAKER_01]: but that showed how much the AI people in Meta are getting.

13:15.164 --> 13:16.922
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they did it themselves.

13:17.290 --> 13:22.221
[SPEAKER_01]: or I suspect because they are trying to basically poach all of the

13:22.201 --> 13:27.975
[SPEAKER_01]: developers, but apparently at least five of them are

13:27.955 --> 13:31.890
[SPEAKER_01]: They all got $10 million signing bonuses.

13:32.022 --> 13:35.282
[SPEAKER_01]: No, excuse me, $100 million signing bonuses

13:35.262 --> 13:38.653
[SPEAKER_01]: and are making 10 million a year apiece.

13:39.360 --> 13:39.703
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

13:40.477 --> 13:46.285
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second fact is well, it's not really a fact or of an announcement but

13:46.265 --> 13:52.073
[SPEAKER_01]: Chapter 85 is supposed to be released this week, like Thursday or Friday.

13:52.711 --> 13:58.722
[SPEAKER_05]: I read something this morning about Apple working on their own AI.

13:58.702 --> 13:58.978
you

13:59.512 --> 14:01.964
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been Siri for years.

14:01.984 --> 14:05.522
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking, OK, it's either going to be called IAI

14:05.502 --> 14:07.960
[SPEAKER_05]: or they're just gonna make Siri smarter.

14:08.645 --> 14:09.370
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

14:09.350 --> 14:12.880
[SPEAKER_01]: well before and I thought this was really lame but

14:12.860 --> 14:18.398
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried to just call it AI, but make the A Apple.

14:18.378 --> 14:22.195
[SPEAKER_01]: So Apple intelligence and they just call it AI.

14:22.175 --> 14:24.594
[SPEAKER_01]: AI is ready to take it.

14:25.158 --> 14:25.823
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

14:28.688 --> 14:30.920
[SPEAKER_07]: A bit late to the game there.

14:31.403 --> 14:32.107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they are.

14:32.127 --> 14:33.957
[SPEAKER_05]: They really are.

14:34.358 --> 14:37.382
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the technology is already developed now.

14:37.632 --> 14:40.896
[SPEAKER_05]: they can kind of piggyback off of what's already out there, I guess.

14:41.359 --> 14:43.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, even Snapchat has an A on it.

14:43.555 --> 14:44.841
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

14:47.538 --> 14:51.979
[SPEAKER_00]: So Blake's here, and you all have to see Andrea.

14:52.381 --> 14:57.784
[SPEAKER_06]: Today he's gone, but he'll be gone here the rest of the week.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.084
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be over.

15:00.785 --> 15:03.447
[SPEAKER_05]: So is Blake going to be the only one on your team that's here?

15:03.810 --> 15:05.665
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he should be the only one.

15:06.151 --> 15:11.132
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, I won't bring my laptop, but um...

15:12.310 --> 15:17.545
[SPEAKER_06]: Text me in probably the easiest way to make sure I see it.

15:17.565 --> 15:18.169
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

15:18.689 --> 15:23.115
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got your number in the emergency contacts thing, right?

15:23.135 --> 15:24.362
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it should be on...

15:28.831 --> 15:29.371
[SPEAKER_05]: SharePoint.

15:29.392 --> 15:30.016
[SPEAKER_05]: SharePoint.

15:31.345 --> 15:32.913
[SPEAKER_05]: I always forget the name of that.

15:34.944 --> 15:37.356
[SPEAKER_05]: I've copied the

15:37.336 --> 15:41.355
[SPEAKER_05]: SharePoint contacts into the

15:41.335 --> 15:46.587
[SPEAKER_05]: Confluence pages for JIRA, they're all kind of

15:46.567 --> 15:48.378
[SPEAKER_05]: Confluence Jura, yeah.

15:48.941 --> 15:52.543
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got those contacts in there so I know where they are so I don't have to go hunting

15:52.523 --> 15:55.463
[SPEAKER_05]: SharePoint, so that's helpful.

15:56.455 --> 16:01.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Last Thursday when Jordan was like freaking out about permissions and everything.

16:01.484 --> 16:03.056
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, do you have Adam's number?

16:03.137 --> 16:04.326
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah.

16:04.488 --> 16:05.314
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, can I have it?

16:05.334 --> 16:06.060
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, uh.

16:06.040 --> 16:10.296
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a touchy place.

16:10.276 --> 16:12.803
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, did I say I have it?

16:12.823 --> 16:14.177
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I have deleted it.

16:14.157 --> 16:16.127
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what do you need it for?

16:16.147 --> 16:17.514
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I'm trying to find permission.

16:17.534 --> 16:20.168
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, hold on, we're talking to Chris right now.

16:20.755 --> 16:26.361
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have permissions, but yeah, Jordan was like, he was like trying to move way faster though.

16:26.341 --> 16:29.061
[SPEAKER_04]: what it was actually

16:30.492 --> 16:34.275
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody needs any supplies, let me know.

16:34.255 --> 16:38.865
[SPEAKER_05]: Is anybody else going to be out just well?

16:38.845 --> 16:42.460
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be a bad week to be gone because everybody's going to DEF CON.

16:42.440 --> 16:48.450
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say my girlfriend's mother is having

16:48.430 --> 16:51.538
[SPEAKER_01]: age and heart-related issues.

16:51.518 --> 16:56.230
[SPEAKER_01]: If something were to happen, I might be out, but I don't think anything will happen.

16:56.210 --> 16:59.875
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll throw a few prayers your way too.

16:59.855 --> 17:02.890
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam was supposed to be out Friday with all this going on.

17:02.910 --> 17:05.342
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he's still leaving him up.

17:05.322 --> 17:07.316
[SPEAKER_06]: How's he feeling today?

17:07.497 --> 17:08.786
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with him yesterday.

17:08.806 --> 17:10.135
[SPEAKER_00]: He was his normal self.

17:10.115 --> 17:11.932
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

17:11.952 --> 17:14.455
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom, she had...

17:14.435 --> 17:15.723
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the same thing.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.996
[SPEAKER_00]: She had chest pains and went in for a stress test.

17:18.016 --> 17:20.209
[SPEAKER_00]: She was on the treadmill for like 10 days.

17:20.189 --> 17:24.968
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds and they saw stuff rushed her to the ER she had a triple bypass

17:24.948 --> 17:25.412
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

17:25.553 --> 17:26.158
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was 45.

17:26.219 --> 17:29.386
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is in the back of Adam's head.

17:29.406 --> 17:30.132
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

17:30.112 --> 17:33.220
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has a stress test today at 9.30.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.601
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he's supposed to meet with the doctor at 12 o'clock.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.164
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they don't see anything,

17:38.144 --> 17:40.338
[SPEAKER_00]: They did give him blood pressure medicine.

17:40.378 --> 17:43.277
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that's what it is, high blood pressure.

17:45.569 --> 17:49.456
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta take blood pressure.

17:49.476 --> 17:49.758
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

17:49.778 --> 17:50.382
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's important.

17:51.290 --> 17:55.697
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they do find stuff, then they'll start doing another test.

17:57.297 --> 17:58.381
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways.

17:58.613 --> 18:00.849
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll update everybody by here.

18:01.111 --> 18:02.520
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sounds good.

18:02.541 --> 18:03.628
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

18:04.925 --> 18:05.488
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

18:07.380 --> 18:09.754
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody have a wonderful day and week.

18:10.342 --> 18:13.888
[SPEAKER_06]: What was his blood pressure, Stacy?

18:13.868 --> 18:15.517
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, wait a minute.

18:15.537 --> 18:19.879
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he went to the video on Friday, he said that the bottom line was 9-9.

18:19.859 --> 18:23.912
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was like, oh.

18:25.394 --> 18:28.485
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they really freaked out.

18:28.465 --> 18:30.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine was like a hundred and something a day.

18:31.001 --> 18:31.162
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

18:31.524 --> 18:32.249
[SPEAKER_00]: The boss member?

18:32.269 --> 18:32.812
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

18:32.832 --> 18:33.919
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was like one, two.

18:33.899 --> 18:34.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
