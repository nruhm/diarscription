1
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:12,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's quiet.

2
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:15,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's stopped.

3
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:17,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

4
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:20,609
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all Stacy's fault.

5
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:21,112
[SPEAKER_01]: My fault?

6
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:21,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

7
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:22,161
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd I do?

8
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:23,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

9
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was talking until you came in.

10
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:28,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically it was me.

11
00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:30,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did.

12
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:36,071
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the first person to know this.

13
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:39,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah that's cool.

14
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:43,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently it is the year of the snake in Chinese.

15
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:48,364
[SPEAKER_01]: calendar and so Xenia Optical like did a snake

16
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:52,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically they have like four or five glasses with little snakes on the sides.

17
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:56,498
[SPEAKER_05]: We got our fact of the day pre-teaser.

18
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:59,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a, is it, is it?

19
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,013
[SPEAKER_00]: It's red.

20
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it like blue light protected?

21
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,505
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's a gimmick.

22
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like the fact that it kind of looks like

23
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:11,010
[SPEAKER_01]: The...

24
00:01:11,598 --> 00:01:15,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyclops from the X-Men had like those red glasses.

25
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,305
[SPEAKER_01]: But supposedly they said like

26
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,410
[SPEAKER_01]: protects you from security cameras because

27
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,708
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll just see like red and then they won't be able to do facial recognition.

28
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:26,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a given.

29
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:28,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Something going on with the meeting?

30
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:28,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Chris.

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,610
[SPEAKER_07]: He said that you guys are muted.

32
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think you hit it like as soon as you started it.

33
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:43,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's probably because like the AI companion thing whenever it was on it shows it was muted and I guess maybe

34
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:45,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to help you.

35
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess we can get started.

36
00:01:50,346 --> 00:01:50,728
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 9-0-1.

37
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:54,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

38
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:59,357
[SPEAKER_05]: As we all know, Adam is having some

39
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,799
[SPEAKER_05]: health issues so he's getting checked out so be thinking about him praying about him

40
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:11,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And other than that, I don't think there's anything.

41
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,574
[SPEAKER_05]: new going on in my world, so.

42
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:22,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just sitting over there taking notes and routing phone calls.

43
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:27,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just go around counterclockwise today.

44
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:31,774
[SPEAKER_06]: You sent Kevin an order out on the...

45
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:35,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday with just kind of a hodgepodge of faces.

46
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:38,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Smaller stove.

47
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:44,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably have Blake working on another one this week.

48
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:49,830
[SPEAKER_06]: He should be good to go on

49
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I think most of the common issues is what we're going to.

50
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:05,997
[SPEAKER_06]: bigger release with designer and cabin order and the builder service.

51
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:17,205
[SPEAKER_04]: When do you owe me from Vegas?

52
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:17,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow.

53
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:17,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

54
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:18,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours ago.

55
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:23,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Jake.

56
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:28,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys going to be able to hit the Slack channel while you're there?

57
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:32,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean as long as we have time.

58
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:38,532
[SPEAKER_05]: well right yeah it'd be cool like you can't actually you're on the floor and

59
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:43,645
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like really strict about pictures.

60
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:49,264
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff, so you can't really take pictures unless you're in a photo area.

61
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:50,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

62
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:53,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess like there's enough.

63
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,246
[SPEAKER_06]: like between like feds and

64
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:01,549
[SPEAKER_06]: borderline criminal and I guess like full blown criminal hackers that

65
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:06,122
[SPEAKER_06]: do come to it, like just, I guess, people that are super strict about their privacy.

66
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:11,404
[SPEAKER_04]: right yeah somebody sees you like taking a picture they can go to like

67
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,792
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that work there will be like, hey, they were taking a picture.

68
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,163
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be like, oh...

69
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:18,247
[SPEAKER_04]: See they need these red glasses.

70
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,162
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, yeah.

71
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:25,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet there's some people running around in there too that have the infrared build things going on there.

72
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:28,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't mask out their faces.

73
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't you say you met the guy from Darknet Diaries?

74
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:31,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

75
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Two years ago, we met.

76
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:37,138
[SPEAKER_04]: His name was Ghost Exodus.

77
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:40,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And we met him there.

78
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he has an episode of Dark Knight Diaries.

79
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,289
[SPEAKER_04]: He went to prison for a little while.

80
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:49,018
[SPEAKER_04]: basically he worked for this healthcare like

81
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:54,267
[SPEAKER_04]: a smaller thing, but they had locked down his computer.

82
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:58,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So he just remoted into one of the servers and

83
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:01,236
[SPEAKER_04]: was doing stuff from there.

84
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:05,353
[SPEAKER_04]: know if he was even IT, but he just found a way to get into their server

85
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:10,568
[SPEAKER_04]: VMs and then was just doing stuff from there.

86
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:14,584
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fed guy, he like posted on him.

87
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:20,575
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube or something about how he was hacking like making it play up like he was doing more than what he was

88
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:25,789
[SPEAKER_04]: This fed agent was trying to make a name for itself, so they threw the hammer.

89
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,514
[SPEAKER_04]: and all he was really doing was remoting into something on prim.

90
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:35,121
[SPEAKER_04]: But since it was medical services and stuff.

91
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,627
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like the runner of this hacker group.

92
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: You went to prison for like 50 meters or something.

93
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was crazy.

94
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:48,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was like, wow.

95
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,055
[SPEAKER_07]: People get up.

96
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:51,062
[SPEAKER_07]: with less for murder.

97
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:52,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

98
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,499
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

99
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you really got it.

100
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,556
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get the best end of the stick.

101
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:02,207
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a nice guy funny enough.

102
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:02,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

103
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:04,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them are, I think.

104
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:04,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

105
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,272
[SPEAKER_05]: What you got going on, Greg?

106
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:11,272
[SPEAKER_05]: You and Stevie were talking about something this morning really interesting.

107
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:11,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

108
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:12,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

109
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:15,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's just working on the embedded devices.

110
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have anything to deliver yet for that.

111
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:18,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

112
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,489
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have an application hub, Chris.

113
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:27,973
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to turn over to testing and then probably a consolidate this one.

114
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we say.

115
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:37,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any releases, but

116
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:42,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been looking on my side quest about ACH transfers.

117
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:45,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I reached out to a company and they were like,

118
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:51,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we really would like there to be at least 10,000 transactions a month.

119
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they just didn't reply to me after that.

120
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:56,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

121
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we give about 7,500 transactions a month.

122
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're only...

123
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.

124
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,786
[SPEAKER_04]: We really want at least $5,000

125
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:09,738
[SPEAKER_04]: and 10,000 plus transactions.

126
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:10,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like,

127
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:16,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was like $500,000 is not any problem at all.

128
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:19,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they just didn't reply.

129
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,243
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty dull on their part, because the cash.

130
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:27,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what it is is with an ACH

131
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:32,149
[SPEAKER_04]: it's so cheap to process they don't do like a percentage or anything so it's really like

132
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,322
[SPEAKER_04]: they make their money off different transactions which

133
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they just group at all.

134
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:41,920
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't even tell me the pricing or anything, so I'm back on the search.

135
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if they would change their mind if we told them that you know we're

136
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Planning on having higher volume eventually because I think Jeff

137
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:55,369
[SPEAKER_07]: wants all of our vendor ACH to eventually be, or vendors to be ACHs.

138
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,065
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like trying it out with some right now.

139
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,159
[SPEAKER_04]: and try to reach out maybe again.

140
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:04,482
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a payment bill at DEF CON

141
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:08,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna go cruise around there and see if there's like

142
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,788
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody has tips on good secure

143
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:18,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't get a tip from some criminal hacker.

144
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:20,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.

145
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:23,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, have you heard of this URL?

146
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:29,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I happen to be the man in the middle on that but we're not saying yeah I think I would do some research when I got back but at least

147
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe somebody could point me.

148
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:32,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

149
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:33,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

150
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:36,527
[SPEAKER_05]: You just can't seem to get your

151
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,456
[SPEAKER_05]: out of finance, can you?

152
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:39,531
[SPEAKER_05]: It just keeps pulling you back.

153
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:43,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when Ethan was gone last week.

154
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:48,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff and Jordan just decided to start calling me again, willy-nilly.

155
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Chris asked me to look into that ACH transfer.

156
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:52,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

157
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:55,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel bad because me and...

158
00:08:55,492 --> 00:09:01,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Chandler like right on the cusp of being able to release this thing we've been working on for like a month and a half too

159
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:06,227
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I'm like, all right, well, I'm gonna be looking at this.

160
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,796
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this thing you're working on?

161
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:10,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That logistics.

162
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:11,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

163
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:16,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiplayer, it's like right there, just like finally.

164
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:17,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing final touches.

165
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So you wanted to do multi?

166
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:24,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So that if two people are using logistics, they won't stomp on each other.

167
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:25,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

168
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:29,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So each time something happens it will refresh from the API.

169
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:34,425
[SPEAKER_04]: This is apparently refreshing, really screw stuff up right now.

170
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:38,813
[SPEAKER_04]: where Jason explains it, I don't know exactly, but...

171
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:41,851
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the CAD part for Jason, right?

172
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:42,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

173
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:44,145
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't...

174
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:47,622
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't what Janelle uses.

175
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:53,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because Janelle is the only one that uses it, so she probably wouldn't really benefit from

176
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,991
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's a few others that use it, but it already has a feature like that.

177
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:59,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how they...

178
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:02,910
[SPEAKER_04]: CNC tab ended up in logistics.

179
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,310
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just a place to put it in.

180
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:11,533
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what I figured the logistics has.

181
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:16,360
[SPEAKER_06]: for the stuff Janelle uses, it has some concurrency like that.

182
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:19,515
[SPEAKER_06]: if one person moves an order into the load,

183
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:26,586
[SPEAKER_06]: they could send a message and it moves that order into that load on all their machines too.

184
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:29,661
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard to test that stuff, isn't it Chris?

185
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:32,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Like concurrency parts and things like that?

186
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:36,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'd have to have two different ones going at once.

187
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:36,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

188
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,959
[SPEAKER_07]: That gives us to Ethan.

189
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:47,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Because for us, we've just been focused on Checksmith.

190
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:50,987
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting pretty close to finishing up the reconciled piece.

191
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:56,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully this week we'll wrap it up and be able to set it to testing and run through.

192
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

193
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,575
[SPEAKER_01]: On our end, recently we did website releases that

194
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:09,003
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I think, last week.

195
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:11,718
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was four minor text change.

196
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And Natalie has done accessibility.

197
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:16,890
[SPEAKER_01]: changes for the website,

198
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:22,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I sent, I can't quite remember, but I think I sent customer portal to testing

199
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:27,488
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe this week we could have a release in just a minute.

200
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:28,670
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on that course.

201
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was for, I think,

202
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:42,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what it was, but it had something to do with bill paid changes.

203
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,490
[SPEAKER_01]: or on your end, I think.

204
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,683
[SPEAKER_07]: They remember something like that, I don't know.

205
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:53,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know all the details because Matt's been talking with her more about it.

206
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:54,577
[SPEAKER_07]: But I see if they're in here.

207
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:55,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

208
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:59,027
[SPEAKER_07]: So once she's ready to push that out, we just gotta...

209
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:02,942
[SPEAKER_07]: push the payment processing API.

210
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:12,983
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be interesting to create some kind of a diagram where this hooks to this, hooks to this,

211
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:15,801
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is, you know, between

212
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:19,648
[SPEAKER_05]: between Andrew's team and your team.

213
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:22,647
[SPEAKER_05]: order entry, how all those talk to each other.

214
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I might do that.

215
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna work on that

216
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:32,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I teams you or something pestering you about that, that's probably what it's about.

217
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably trying to draw pictures.

218
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:37,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be cool to have a full program.

219
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:41,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everything starts in orders and then it traces through.

220
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:42,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a map.

221
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

222
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:48,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one of those, what's the guy from the TV show that has like the wall?

223
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,813
[SPEAKER_04]: From It's Always Sunny.

224
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:52,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

225
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Pick me Sylvia.

226
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Sylvia Scott.

227
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, wait a second.

228
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Got any facts?

229
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:04,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two they're both AI facts.

230
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:10,510
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a leak, I suspect that they did it themselves,

231
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,998
[SPEAKER_01]: but that showed how much the AI people in Meta are getting.

232
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:16,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they did it themselves.

233
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,221
[SPEAKER_01]: or I suspect because they are trying to basically poach all of the

234
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:27,975
[SPEAKER_01]: developers, but apparently at least five of them are

235
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:31,890
[SPEAKER_01]: They all got $10 million signing bonuses.

236
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:35,282
[SPEAKER_01]: No, excuse me, $100 million signing bonuses

237
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:38,653
[SPEAKER_01]: and are making 10 million a year apiece.

238
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

239
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:46,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second fact is well, it's not really a fact or of an announcement but

240
00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:52,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Chapter 85 is supposed to be released this week, like Thursday or Friday.

241
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:58,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I read something this morning about Apple working on their own AI.

242
00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:58,978
you

243
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:01,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been Siri for years.

244
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:05,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking, OK, it's either going to be called IAI

245
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:07,960
[SPEAKER_05]: or they're just gonna make Siri smarter.

246
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:09,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

247
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,880
[SPEAKER_01]: well before and I thought this was really lame but

248
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,398
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried to just call it AI, but make the A Apple.

249
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:22,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So Apple intelligence and they just call it AI.

250
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:24,594
[SPEAKER_01]: AI is ready to take it.

251
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:25,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

252
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:30,920
[SPEAKER_07]: A bit late to the game there.

253
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they are.

254
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:33,957
[SPEAKER_05]: They really are.

255
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:37,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the technology is already developed now.

256
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:40,896
[SPEAKER_05]: they can kind of piggyback off of what's already out there, I guess.

257
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, even Snapchat has an A on it.

258
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:44,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

259
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:51,979
[SPEAKER_00]: So Blake's here, and you all have to see Andrea.

260
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:57,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Today he's gone, but he'll be gone here the rest of the week.

261
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,084
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be over.

262
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So is Blake going to be the only one on your team that's here?

263
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he should be the only one.

264
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:11,132
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, I won't bring my laptop, but um...

265
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Text me in probably the easiest way to make sure I see it.

266
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:18,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

267
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:23,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got your number in the emergency contacts thing, right?

268
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it should be on...

269
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:29,371
[SPEAKER_05]: SharePoint.

270
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:30,016
[SPEAKER_05]: SharePoint.

271
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:32,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I always forget the name of that.

272
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:37,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I've copied the

273
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:41,355
[SPEAKER_05]: SharePoint contacts into the

274
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:46,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Confluence pages for JIRA, they're all kind of

275
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Confluence Jura, yeah.

276
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:52,543
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got those contacts in there so I know where they are so I don't have to go hunting

277
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:55,463
[SPEAKER_05]: SharePoint, so that's helpful.

278
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:01,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Last Thursday when Jordan was like freaking out about permissions and everything.

279
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:03,056
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, do you have Adam's number?

280
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:04,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah.

281
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:05,314
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, can I have it?

282
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, uh.

283
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a touchy place.

284
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:12,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, did I say I have it?

285
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:14,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I have deleted it.

286
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:16,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what do you need it for?

287
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:17,514
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I'm trying to find permission.

288
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:20,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, hold on, we're talking to Chris right now.

289
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:26,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have permissions, but yeah, Jordan was like, he was like trying to move way faster though.

290
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:29,061
[SPEAKER_04]: what it was actually

291
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:34,275
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody needs any supplies, let me know.

292
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:38,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Is anybody else going to be out just well?

293
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:42,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be a bad week to be gone because everybody's going to DEF CON.

294
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say my girlfriend's mother is having

295
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,538
[SPEAKER_01]: age and heart-related issues.

296
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:56,230
[SPEAKER_01]: If something were to happen, I might be out, but I don't think anything will happen.

297
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll throw a few prayers your way too.

298
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:02,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam was supposed to be out Friday with all this going on.

299
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he's still leaving him up.

300
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:07,316
[SPEAKER_06]: How's he feeling today?

301
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:08,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with him yesterday.

302
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,135
[SPEAKER_00]: He was his normal self.

303
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:11,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

304
00:17:11,952 --> 00:17:14,455
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom, she had...

305
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:15,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the same thing.

306
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,996
[SPEAKER_00]: She had chest pains and went in for a stress test.

307
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:20,209
[SPEAKER_00]: She was on the treadmill for like 10 days.

308
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,968
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds and they saw stuff rushed her to the ER she had a triple bypass

309
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:25,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

310
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:26,158
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was 45.

311
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:29,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is in the back of Adam's head.

312
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:30,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

313
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:33,220
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has a stress test today at 9.30.

314
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,601
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he's supposed to meet with the doctor at 12 o'clock.

315
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,164
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they don't see anything,

316
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,338
[SPEAKER_00]: They did give him blood pressure medicine.

317
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:43,277
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that's what it is, high blood pressure.

318
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:49,456
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta take blood pressure.

319
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:49,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

320
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's important.

321
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,697
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they do find stuff, then they'll start doing another test.

322
00:17:57,297 --> 00:17:58,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways.

323
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:00,849
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll update everybody by here.

324
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:02,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sounds good.

325
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

326
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:05,488
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

327
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody have a wonderful day and week.

328
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:13,888
[SPEAKER_06]: What was his blood pressure, Stacy?

329
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:15,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, wait a minute.

330
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:19,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he went to the video on Friday, he said that the bottom line was 9-9.

331
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was like, oh.

332
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:28,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they really freaked out.

333
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:30,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine was like a hundred and something a day.

334
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:31,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

335
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:32,249
[SPEAKER_00]: The boss member?

336
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:32,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

337
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:33,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was like one, two.

338
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:34,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
