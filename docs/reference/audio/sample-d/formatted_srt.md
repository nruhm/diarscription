1 00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:12,300 SPEAKER_00: Well, it's quiet.
2 00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:15,863 SPEAKER_00: Everything's stopped.
3 00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:17,383 SPEAKER_00:
4 00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:20,609 SPEAKER_01: It's all Stacey's fault.
5 00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:21,112 SPEAKER_02: My fault?
6 00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:21,556 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
7 00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:22,161 SPEAKER_01: What'd I do?
8 00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:23,027 SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
9 00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,418 SPEAKER_01: Everybody was talking until you came in.
9 00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,418 SPEAKER_02: Awkward.
10 00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:28,753 SPEAKER_03: Technically it was me.
10 00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:28,753 SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay.
11 00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:30,763 SPEAKER_03: I think I did.
12 00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:36,071 SPEAKER_03: You're the first person to know this, but I got glasses with little snakes on it.
13 00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:39,353 SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah that's cool.
14 00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:43,656 SPEAKER_03: Well, apparently it is the year of the snake in Chinese.
15 00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:48,364 SPEAKER_03: calendar and so Zenni Optical like did a snake
16 00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:52,937 SPEAKER_03: Basically they have like four or five glasses with little snakes on the sides.
17 00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:56,498 SPEAKER_00: Nice. We got our fact of the day pre-teaser.
18 00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:59,805 SPEAKER_02: Do you have a, is it, is it?
19 00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,013 SPEAKER_02: It's red.
20 00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,771 SPEAKER_02: So is it like blue light protected?
21 00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,505 SPEAKER_03: You know, I think it's a gimmick.
22 00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,762 SPEAKER_03: I just like the fact that it kind of looks like
23 00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:11,010 SPEAKER_03: The...
24 00:01:11,598 --> 00:01:15,235 SPEAKER_03: Cyclops from the X-Men had like those red glasses.
24 00:01:11,598 --> 00:01:15,235 SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, right.
25 00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,305 SPEAKER_03: But supposedly they said it like
26 00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,410 SPEAKER_03: protects you from security cameras because
27 00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,708 SPEAKER_03: they'll just see like red and then they won't be able to do facial recognition.
28 00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:26,880 SPEAKER_03: I think that's a gimmick.
29 00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:28,073 SPEAKER_00: Something going on with the meeting?
30 00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:28,780 SPEAKER_04: Hi, Chris.
30 00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:28,780 SPEAKER_01: I think you muted him when you signed in.
30 00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:28,780 SPEAKER_00: Oh is he muted? Oh, okay.
31 00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,610 SPEAKER_04: He said that you guys are muted.
31 00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,610 SPEAKER_00: Oh.
32 00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,875 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think you hit it like as soon as you started it.
33 00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:43,343 SPEAKER_04: I think it's probably because like the AI companion thing whenever it was on it shows it was muted and I guess maybe
33 00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:43,343 SPEAKER_01: Oh.
34 00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:45,655 SPEAKER_04: It tried to unmute
34 00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:45,655 SPEAKER_01: Gotcha.
35 00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,285 SPEAKER_00: Well, I guess we can get started.
36 00:01:50,346 --> 00:01:50,728 SPEAKER_00: It's 9:01.
37 00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:54,447 SPEAKER_00: Yay.
38 00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:59,357 SPEAKER_00: As we all know, Adam is having some
39 00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,799 SPEAKER_00: health issues so he's getting checked out so be thinking about him praying about him
40 00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:11,929 SPEAKER_00: And other than that, I don't think there's anything.
41 00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,574 SPEAKER_00: new going on in my world, so.
42 00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:22,172 SPEAKER_00: I'm kind of just sitting over there taking notes and routing phone calls.
43 00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:27,792 SPEAKER_00: Let me just go around counterclockwise today.
44 00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:31,774 SPEAKER_05: Sent Cabinet Door Order out on the...

49 00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,893 SPEAKER_05: I think like most of the common issues is what we're going to.
50 00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:05,997 SPEAKER_05: Probably look at bigger release with designer and cabin order and the builder service.
50 00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:05,997 SPEAKER_05: Probably a week after we get back here from Vegas
51 00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:17,205 SPEAKER_00: When do you all leave for Vegas?
52 00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:17,407 SPEAKER_05: Tomorrow.

71 00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:25,967 SPEAKER_01: There's some interesting characters
72 00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:28,038 SPEAKER_00: It'll mask out their faces.
73 00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,993 SPEAKER_04: Didn't you say you met the guy from Darknet Diaries?
74 00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:31,958 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
74 00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:31,958 SPEAKER_04: Last time.

77 00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:40,176 SPEAKER_01: And we met him there.
78 00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,270 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he has an episode of Darknet Diaries.
79 00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,289 SPEAKER_01: He went to prison for a little while.
80 00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:49,018 SPEAKER_01: basically he worked for this healthcare like, thing.
81 00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:54,267 SPEAKER_01: a smaller thing, but they had locked down his computer.
82 00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:58,215 SPEAKER_01: So he just remoted into one of the servers and
83 00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:01,236 SPEAKER_01: was doing stuff from there.
84 00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:05,353 SPEAKER_01: I don't know if he was even IT, but he just found a way to get into their server
85 00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:10,568 SPEAKER_01: VMs and then was just doing stuff from there.
86 00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:14,584 SPEAKER_01: The Fed guy, he like posted on...
87 00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:20,575 SPEAKER_01: YouTube or something about how he was hacking like making it play up like he was doing more than what he was
88 00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:25,789 SPEAKER_01: This fed agent was trying to make a name for himself, so they threw the hammer at him.
89 00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,514 SPEAKER_01: and all he was really doing was remoting into something on prem.
89 00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,514 SPEAKER_00: Right.
90 00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:35,121 SPEAKER_01: But since it was medical services and stuff.
91 00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,627 SPEAKER_01: He was like the runner of this hacker group.
92 00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:43,788 SPEAKER_01: You went to prison for like 15 years or something.
92 00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:43,788 SPEAKER_00: I'm a hacker, I can use RDP.
93 00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,617 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was crazy.
94 00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:48,441 SPEAKER_06: Was it 15 years?
94 00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:48,441 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was like...
94 00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:48,441 SPEAKER_00: Wow.
94 00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:48,441 SPEAKER_01: A good chunk of time.
95 00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,055 SPEAKER_04: People get off.
96 00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:51,062 SPEAKER_04: with less for murder.
97 00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:52,250 SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
97 00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:52,250 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

100 00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,556 SPEAKER_01: Didn't get the best end of the stick.
100 00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,556 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
101 00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:02,207 SPEAKER_01: He's a nice guy funny enough.
102 00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:02,328 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
103 00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:04,162 SPEAKER_00: Most of them are, I think.
104 00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:04,787 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
105 00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,272 SPEAKER_00: What you got going on, Greg?
106 00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:11,272 SPEAKER_00: You and Stevie were talking about something this morning really interesting.
107 00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:11,976 SPEAKER_06: Oh, yeah.
108 00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:12,669 SPEAKER_06:
109 00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:15,829 SPEAKER_06: Yeah, she's just working on the embedded devices.
110 00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,468 SPEAKER_06: We don't have anything to deliver yet for that.
111 00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:18,810 SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh.
112 00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,489 SPEAKER_06: We do have an application hub, Chris.
113 00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:27,973 SPEAKER_02: we're going to turn over to testing and then probably a consolidate this week.
114 00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,404 SPEAKER_02: Awesome, sounds good.
114 00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,404 SPEAKER_06: I think that's about it. Just those two
115 00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:37,947 SPEAKER_01: I don't have any releases, but
116 00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:42,165 SPEAKER_01: I've been looking on my side quest about ACH transfers.
117 00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:45,962 SPEAKER_01: I reached out to a company and they were like,
118 00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:51,953 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we really would like there to be at least 10,000 transactions a month.
119 00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,608 SPEAKER_01: Then they just didn't reply to me after that.
120 00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:56,577 SPEAKER_00: Wow.
121 00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,181 SPEAKER_01: I think we give about 7,500 transactions a month.
122 00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,128 SPEAKER_05: So you're only...
123 00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,116 SPEAKER_04: Right there.
124 00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,786 SPEAKER_01: We really want at least $5,000
125 00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:09,738 SPEAKER_01: and 10,000 plus transactions.
126 00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:10,465 SPEAKER_01: And I was like,
127 00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:16,472 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I was like $500,000 is not any problem at all.
128 00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:19,408 SPEAKER_01: And then they just didn't reply.
129 00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,243 SPEAKER_05: That's pretty dumb on their part, because their cash volume has to be like.
130 00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:27,154 SPEAKER_01: Well, I think what it is is with an ACH
131 00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:32,149 SPEAKER_01: it's so cheap to process they don't do like a percentage or anything so it's really like
132 00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,322 SPEAKER_01: they make their money off different transactions which
133 00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,517 SPEAKER_01: I'm sure they just group it all.
134 00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:41,920 SPEAKER_01: They wouldn't even tell me the pricing or anything, so I'm back on the search.
135 00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,560 SPEAKER_06: I wonder if they would change their mind if we told them that you know we're
136 00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,458 SPEAKER_06: Planning on having higher volume eventually because I think Jeff
137 00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:55,369 SPEAKER_06: wants all of our vendor ACH to eventually be, or vendors to be ACHs.
137 00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:55,369 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't know.
138 00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,065 SPEAKER_06: It's kind of like trying it out with some right now.
139 00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,159 SPEAKER_01: and try to reach out maybe again.
140 00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:04,482 SPEAKER_01: There's actually a payment village at DEF CON
141 00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:08,110 SPEAKER_01: So I'm gonna go cruise around there and see if there's like
142 00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,788 SPEAKER_01: anybody has tips on good secure payment things
143 00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:18,167 SPEAKER_05: Just don't get a tip from some criminal hacker.
144 00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:20,100 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, definitely.
145 00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:23,905 SPEAKER_01: It's like, oh, have you heard of this URL?
146 00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:29,895 SPEAKER_00: I happen to be the man in the middle on that
146 00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:29,895 SPEAKER_01: but we're not saying yeah I think I would do some research when I got back but at least
147 00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,488 SPEAKER_01: Maybe somebody could point me.
148 00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:32,933 SPEAKER_00: Oh, Gosh.
149 00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:33,237 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
150 00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:36,527 SPEAKER_00: You just can't seem to get your
151 00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,456 SPEAKER_00: foot out of finance, can you?
151 00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,456 SPEAKER_01: I know.
152 00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:39,531 SPEAKER_00: It just keeps pulling you back.
153 00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:43,125 SPEAKER_01: Especially when Ethan was gone last week.
154 00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:48,340 SPEAKER_01: Jeff and Jordan just decided to start calling me again, willy-nilly.
155 00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,723 SPEAKER_01: And then Chris asked me to look into that ACH transfer.
156 00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:52,508 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
157 00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:55,512 SPEAKER_01: I feel bad because me and...
158 00:08:55,492 --> 00:09:01,502 SPEAKER_01: Chandler like right on the cusp of being able to release this thing we've been working on for like a month and a half, too.
159 00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:06,227 SPEAKER_01: and then I'm like, all right, well, I'm gonna be looking at this.
160 00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,796 SPEAKER_00: What's this thing you're working on?
161 00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:10,050 SPEAKER_01: That logistics.
162 00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:11,458 SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah.
163 00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:16,572 SPEAKER_01: Where it's kind of like multiplayer, it's like right there, just like finally.
164 00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:17,626 SPEAKER_01: Doing final touches.
165 00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,288 SPEAKER_00: So you wanted to do multi?
166 00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:24,638 SPEAKER_00: So that if two people are using logistics, they won't stomp on each other.
167 00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:25,546 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.
168 00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:29,177 SPEAKER_01: So each time something happens it will refresh from the API.
168 00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:29,177 SPEAKER_00: Nice
169 00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:34,425 SPEAKER_01: Apparently refreshing, really screws stuff up right now.
170 00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:38,813 SPEAKER_01: when Jason explains it, I don't know exactly, but...
171 00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:41,851 SPEAKER_00: But this is the CAD part for Jason, right?
172 00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:42,234 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
173 00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:44,145 SPEAKER_00: This isn't...
173 00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:44,145 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
174 00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:47,622 SPEAKER_00: This isn't what Janelle uses.
174 00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:47,622 SPEAKER_01: No.
175 00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:53,393 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because Janelle is the only one that uses it, so she probably wouldn't really benefit from
176 00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,991 SPEAKER_05: No, there's a few others that use it, but it already has a feature like that.
176 00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,991 SPEAKER_00: Really? Okay.
177 00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:59,383 SPEAKER_01: I don't know how they...
178 00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:02,910 SPEAKER_01: CNC tab ended up in logistics.
178 00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:02,910 SPEAKER_00: It seems odd for it.
179 00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,310 SPEAKER_06: It was just a place to put it in.
180 00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:11,533 SPEAKER_01: That's kind of what I figured.
181 00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:16,360 SPEAKER_05: the logistics has for the stuff Janelle uses, it has some concurrency like that.
182 00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:19,515 SPEAKER_05: Where like, if one person moves an order into the load,
183 00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:26,586 SPEAKER_05: they could send a message and it moves that order into that load on all their machines too.
184 00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:29,661 SPEAKER_00: It's really hard to test that stuff, isn't it Chris?
185 00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:32,762 SPEAKER_00: Like concurrency parts and things like that?
186 00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:36,003 SPEAKER_07: Yeah, we'd have to have two different ones going at once.
187 00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:36,728 SPEAKER_00: Right.
188 00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,959 SPEAKER_00: That gives us to Ethan.
189 00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:47,038 SPEAKER_04: Because for us, we've just been focused on Checksmith.
190 00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:50,987 SPEAKER_04: We're getting pretty close to finishing up the reconciled piece.
191 00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:56,978 SPEAKER_04: Hopefully this week we'll wrap it up and be able to set it to testing and run through.
192 00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,351 SPEAKER_00: Nice.
192 00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,351 SPEAKER_00: Web stuff.
193 00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,575 SPEAKER_03: On our end, recently we did website releases that
194 00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:09,003 SPEAKER_03: It was, I think, last week.
195 00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:11,718 SPEAKER_03: But there was four minor text change.
196 00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,448 SPEAKER_03: And Natalie has done accessibility.
197 00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:16,890 SPEAKER_03: changes for the website,
198 00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:22,105 SPEAKER_03: I think I sent, I can't quite remember, but I think I sent customer portal to testing
199 00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:27,488 SPEAKER_03: So maybe this week we could have a release.
200 00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:28,670 SPEAKER_03: It just depends how that goes.
201 00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,849 SPEAKER_03: And that was for, I think,
202 00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:42,557 SPEAKER_03: I don't know exactly what it was, but it had something to do with bill paid changes.
203 00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,490 SPEAKER_03: or on your end, I think.
204 00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,683 SPEAKER_00: Vaguely remember something like that, I don't know.
205 00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:53,188 SPEAKER_04: I don't know all the details because Matt's been talking with her more about it.
206 00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:54,577 SPEAKER_03: But I think they're prepared.
207 00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:55,604 SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
208 00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:59,027 SPEAKER_04: So once she's ready to push that out, we just gotta...
209 00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:02,942 SPEAKER_04: push the payment processing API.
210 00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:12,983 SPEAKER_00: It might be interesting to create some kind of a diagram where this hooks to this, hooks to this, hooks to this.
211 00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:15,801 SPEAKER_00: So, you know, between.
212 00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:19,648 SPEAKER_00: between Andrew's team and your team.
213 00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:22,647 SPEAKER_00: And order entry, and how all those talk to each other.
214 00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,643 SPEAKER_00: I might do that.
215 00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,213 SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna work on that
216 00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:32,288 SPEAKER_00: So if I teams you or something pestering you about that, that's probably what it's about.
217 00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,339 SPEAKER_00: I'm probably trying to draw pictures.
218 00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:37,215 SPEAKER_01: It would be cool to have a full program.
219 00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:41,144 SPEAKER_01: Because everything starts in orders and then it traces through.
220 00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:42,615 SPEAKER_04: Like a map.
221 00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,843 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.
222 00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:48,252 SPEAKER_01: Like one of those, what's the guy from the TV show that has like the wall web?
223 00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,813 SPEAKER_04: From It's Always Sunny.
224 00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:52,909 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
225 00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,039 SPEAKER_05: It's Silvia.
226 00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,967 SPEAKER_01: It's gonna be Scott.
227 00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,550 SPEAKER_01: I was like, wait a second.
228 00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,357 SPEAKER_00: Got any facts?
229 00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:04,553 SPEAKER_03: I have two they're both AI facts.
230 00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:10,510 SPEAKER_03: One, there was a leak, I suspect that they did it themselves,
231 00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,998 SPEAKER_03: but that showed how much the AI people in Meta are getting.
232 00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:16,922 SPEAKER_03: And I think they did it themselves.
233 00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,221 SPEAKER_03: or I suspect because they are trying to basically poach all of the
234 00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:27,975 SPEAKER_03: developers, but apparently at least five of them are
235 00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:31,890 SPEAKER_03: They all got $10 million signing bonuses.
236 00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:35,282 SPEAKER_03: No, excuse me, $100 million signing bonuses
237 00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:38,653 SPEAKER_03: and are making 10 million a year apiece.
238 00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,703 SPEAKER_01: Wow.
239 00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:46,285 SPEAKER_03: And then the second fact is well, it's not really a fact or of an announcement but
240 00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:52,073 SPEAKER_03: Chat GPT 5 is supposed to be released this week, like Thursday or Friday.
241 00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:58,722 SPEAKER_00: I read something this morning about Apple working on their own AI.
242 00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:58,978 SPEAKER_00:
243 00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:01,964 SPEAKER_01: It's been Siri for years.
244 00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:05,522 SPEAKER_00: I'm thinking, OK, it's either going to be called IAI
245 00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:07,960 SPEAKER_00: or they're just gonna make Siri smarter.
246 00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:09,370 SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
247 00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,880 SPEAKER_03: well before and I thought this was really lame but
248 00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,398 SPEAKER_03: They tried to just call it AI, but make the A Apple.
249 00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:22,195 SPEAKER_03: So Apple intelligence and they just call it AI.
250 00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:24,594 SPEAKER_03: AI is already taken.
251 00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:25,823 SPEAKER_00: Right.
252 00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:30,920 SPEAKER_04: A bit late to the game there.
253 00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,107 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, they are.
254 00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:33,957 SPEAKER_00: They really are.
255 00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:37,382 SPEAKER_00: Of course, the technology is already developed now.
256 00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:40,896 SPEAKER_00: they can kind of piggyback off of what's already out there, I guess.
257 00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,575 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, even Snapchat has an AI on it.
258 00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:44,841 SPEAKER_01:
259 00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:51,979 SPEAKER_02: So Blake's here, and you all are gone. Is he in charge?
260 00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:57,784 SPEAKER_05: Today he's gone, but he'll be gone here the rest of the week.
261 00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,084 SPEAKER_05: It should be alright.
262 00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,447 SPEAKER_00: So is Blake going to be the only one on your team that's here?
263 00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,665 SPEAKER_05: Yeah, he should be the only one.
263 00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,665 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
264 00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:11,132 SPEAKER_05: If not, I won't bring my laptop, but um...
265 00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,545 SPEAKER_05: Text me in probably the easiest way to make sure I see it.
266 00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:18,169 SPEAKER_00: Okay.
267 00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:23,115 SPEAKER_00: So you got your number in the emergency contacts thing, right?
268 00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,362 SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it should be on, what's it called?
269 00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:29,371 SPEAKER_00: SharePoint.
270 00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:30,016 SPEAKER_06: SharePoint.
271 00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:32,913 SPEAKER_00: I always forget the name of that.
271 00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:32,913 SPEAKER_05: I did too.
272 00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:37,356 SPEAKER_00: I've got, I've copied the
273 00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:41,355 SPEAKER_00: SharePoint contacts into the
274 00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:46,587 SPEAKER_00: Confluence pages for Jira, they're all kind of
275 00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,378 SPEAKER_00: Confluence Jira, yeah.
276 00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:52,543 SPEAKER_00: So I've got those contacts in there so I know where they are so I don't have to go hunting in
277 00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:55,463 SPEAKER_00: SharePoint, so that's helpful.
278 00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:01,504 SPEAKER_01: Last Thursday when Jordan was like freaking out about permissions and everything.
279 00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:03,056 SPEAKER_01: He's like, do you have Adam's number?
280 00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:04,326 SPEAKER_01: I was like, yeah.
281 00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:05,314 SPEAKER_01: He's like, can I have it?
282 00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,060 SPEAKER_01: I'm like, uh.
283 00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,296 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's a touchy place.
284 00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:12,803 SPEAKER_08: Wait, did I say I have it?
285 00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:14,177 SPEAKER_08: I guess I have deleted it.
286 00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:16,127 SPEAKER_01: I was like, what do you need it for?
287 00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:17,514 SPEAKER_01: He's like, I'm trying to find permission.
288 00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:20,168 SPEAKER_01: I was like, hold on, we're talking to Chris right now.
289 00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:26,361 SPEAKER_01: I don't have permissions, but yeah, Jordan was like, he was like trying to move way faster though.
290 00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:29,061 SPEAKER_01: what it was actually working
291 00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:34,275 SPEAKER_02: If anybody needs any supplies, let me know I'll order them this week.
292 00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:38,865 SPEAKER_00: Is anybody else going to be out just, just well?
293 00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:42,460 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it would be a bad week to be gone because everybody's going to DEF CON.
294 00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,450 SPEAKER_03: I will say my girlfriend's mother is having
295 00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,538 SPEAKER_03: age and heart-related issues.
296 00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:56,230 SPEAKER_03: So if something were to happen, I might be out, but I don't think anything will happen.
297 00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,875 SPEAKER_00: I'll throw a few prayers your way too.
297 00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,875 SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
298 00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:02,890 SPEAKER_02: Adam was supposed to be out Friday with all this going on.
299 00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,342 SPEAKER_02: I don't know if he's still leaving or not.
300 00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:07,316 SPEAKER_05: How's he feeling today?
301 00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:08,786 SPEAKER_02: I was with him yesterday.
302 00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,135 SPEAKER_02: He was his normal self, but nervous.
303 00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:11,932 SPEAKER_05: Right.
304 00:17:11,952 --> 00:17:14,455 SPEAKER_02: My mom, she had...
305 00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:15,723 SPEAKER_02: Kind of the same thing.
306 00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,996 SPEAKER_02: She had chest pains and went in for a stress test.
